            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM ORTELL, COSMOGRAPHER TO PHILIP THE SECOND, LATE KING OF SPAINE, written firſt in Latine by <hi>Francis Sweert</hi> of Antwerpe, his familiar <hi>and louing friend, and now tranſlated into Engliſh by</hi> W. B, <hi>as great a louer of his learning and vertues.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſtocke of the ORTELS flouriſhed not long ſince, and liued in good ſtate and credit at Auſpurg in Bayern, (<hi>Auguſtam vindelicorum,</hi> the Latines called it.) From that family came WILLIAM ORTELL, who about the yere of our Lord 1460 left his natiue country, and ſeated himſelfe in Antwerpe, (at that time one of the famouſeſt Mart-townes of the world) where he did many notable things worthily deſeruing great commendation: among which that is moſt memorable, that of his owne proper coſt and charges he cauſed a goodly croſſe of free ſtone to be ſet vp without the Emperours gate, in that place where the malefactours are vſually woont to be executed and put to death. Beneath this croſſe, at the baſe or foot of the ſame, ſtood Mary and Iohn, and beſide them, a little farther off, hung the two theeues; the one vpon the right hand and the other vpon the left, vpon their ſeuerall gibbets. This <hi>William</hi> died vpon the ſeuenth day of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary in the yeere of our Lord God 1511, and was buried in the cloiſters of the Franciſcane Friers in Antwerpe, leauing his ſonne LEONARD ORTELL ſole Executor, and heire, not only of his goods and ſubſtance, but alſo of his vertues and good qualities: For they report that he was a man ſo deuout and religious, that it was an hard matter to finde him from his booke, ſerious meditation on heauenly matters. This <hi>Leonard</hi> maried ANNA HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VVAYERS, and by her had iſſue two daughters, and one ſome named ABRAHAM, (whoſe life we heere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deſcribe) borne vpon the ſecond day of Aprill, in the yeere of our Lord God 1527. Hee was euen in his child-hood of ſingular towardneſſe, great capacity and paſsing quicke conceit, and, that which is very ſtrange in youth, hee was neuer giuen to the reading of any trifles or idle vanities. Wherefore his father purpoſing to make him a ſcholar, began firſt himſelfe to inſtruct him priuatly at home in his owne houſe in the Latine and Greeke tongues: (For the old man was very learned in both theſe languages.) But ſee how theſe good purpoſes were ſoon croſſed by the vntimely death of his moſt louing and kinde father! who departing this life, in the yeere of Chriſt 1535, left this his ſonne to be further informed and taught abroade by ſtrange ſchoolemaſters, whoſe care and diligence to profit him, whatſoeuer their learning were, was nothing ſo great and painfull: notwithſtanding euen vnder theſe he made ſuch profit in the Artes and liberall Sciences, that he was not much inferiour to the beſt of his degree and time: For, as I ſaid before, no vaine pleaſure, or trifles, paſtimes (which commonly are the ouerthrow of many yongue men) could euer with-draw him from his ſetled purpoſe, or alienate his minde from his booke. Yet his greateſt delight and commendation conſiſted in the knowledge of the Mathematicall ſciences, which for the moſt part he ſtudied and practiſed without an inſtructor, or teacher, atteining, only by his owne paines and induſtrie, to the great admiration of others, euen to the vnderſtanding of the greateſt and deepeſt myſteries of the ſame. In the thirtieth yeare of his age, hauing many great matters in his head, and loathing to liue idly at home in his owne natiue country, he began to entertaine a conceipt of trauelling into diuers and ſundry forreine parts and countries of the world. To Frankford vpon the Main, by reaſon of the great Marts or Faires, there held at two ſeuerall times euery yere, he went very often. In the yeere of our Lord 1575, he went with <hi>Iohn Viuian</hi> of Valence, a Marchant, but a great louer of learning, and <hi>Hierome Scoliers</hi> of Antwerp, to Leige, Trier; Tungren and Mentz: of which iourney and peregrination of theirs, there is at this day a booke of his exſtant in print, wherein he hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly deſcribed the particulars obſerued by them. In the yeere of Chriſt 1577, with <hi>Immanuël Demetrius</hi> of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe, hee trauelled beyond the Seas, into England and Ireland. Italy, that nource of great wits, that worker of ſtrange woonders, that mother of reuerend antiquities and ancient monuments, hee viſited thriſe. The third time that he went thither, which was in the yeere 1578, he went in company of <hi>George Houfnayle</hi> of Antwerp, who was ſo excellent a painter that he was greatly eſteemed and beloued of the illuſtrious princes, <hi>Albert</hi> and <hi>VVilliam,</hi> Dukes of Bayern: of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Duke of Auſtrich; yea and of <hi>Rudolphus</hi> himſelfe, at that time Emperour of the Germanes. But this his conſort, to the great greefe of his friends and ſuch as loued his ſingular qualities, left his life at Prage in Bohemia, vpon the thirteenth of Ianuary in the yeere of our Lord, 1600. This man was woorthy of longer life, if the Fates would reſpect men for their great parts and excellent vertues. But ſo it is, that Death, like as the ſythe in Harueſt, cutteth downe, without diſtinction, aſwell the yongue as old. There was nothing either in Germanie or in France, that was woorth the ſeeing, that this our authour had not ſeene and viewed with a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious and iudicious eie. At length, hauing ouercome ſo many tedious and toilſome trauels, he returned againe to Antwerpe his natiue ſoile. There and then he began to apply himſelfe to benefit ſuccedent ages, to write of
<pb facs="tcp:23194:3"/> thoſe countries by him viewed and ſeene, to ſet out in Charts and Mappes diuers places both of Sea and Land vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to former ages, to deſcribe the tracts and coaſts of the Eaſt and Weſt, South and North neuer ſpoken of nor touched by Ptolemey, Pliny, Strabo, Mela or any other hiſtoriographer whatſoeuer: and laſtly to bend all his forces to the framing of that his THEATER, which now is beheld and read with ſuch admiration and applauſe of all men: in which worke of his he was ſo generally well liked and approued of all, that Philip the Second, that renowmed King of Spaine, graced him with the honour and title of <hi>The Kings Coſmographer.</hi> He wrot alſo his GEOGRAPHICALL TREASVRE, a very learned and pleaſant worke, in which the ancient names or appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, (yea and oft times the new, by which they are now called and knowen at this day,) of Mountaines, Hils, Promontories, Woods, Ilands, Hauens, People, Cities, Townes, Villages, Seas, Baies, Creekes, Straights, Riuers, &amp;c. are at one view inſtantly to be ſeene. Moreouer, out of ancient coines, for the benefit and delight of ſuch as are louers and ſtudious of antiquities, he ſet out The HEADS OF THE GODS AND GODDESSES, which afterward were illuſtrated with an hiſtoricall narration or diſcourſe done by Francis Sweert the yonger. In the yeere of Chriſt 1596, he ſet forth THE IMAGE OF THE GOLDEN WORLD, that is, A treatiſe deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the life, Maners, Cuſtomes, Rites and Religion of the ancient Germans, collected and gathered out of diuers and ſundry old writers of both languages. By theſe his labours and trauels he hath gotten and purchaſed vnto himſelfe an immortall name and credit amongſt the learned of all ſorts. In company he was of an excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete cariage, paſsing courteous, merry and pleaſant. Such was his ſingular humanity, that it was ſtrange to ſee how he did winne and retaine the loue and fauour of all men whereſoeuer he became. His enemies he choſe rather to ouercome with kindneſſe, or to contemne them then to reuenge himſelfe of their malice. He did ſo much hate vice, euen in his owne kindred, that he rather reuerenced vertue in his enemies and ſtrangers. Vaine queſtions, and ſubtill diſputations of diuinity, or matters of religion, as dangerous and pernicious, hee did alwaies greatly deteſt and abhorre. A deepe in-ſight and ſound iudgment in any kinde of matter, he preferred before gloſing elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and quaint termes. Preſent aduerſity and daungers he alwaies endured with more patience then feare of ſuch as were comming on and neere at hand: and thoſe which were bitter, more eaſily then ſuch as were doubtfull and vncertaine of euent. He was a man which in his life time did ſet as little by himſelfe as any man could: For he neuer ſet his minde much vpon the wealth of this world, or ought of thoſe things in the ſame, hauing alwaies in memory that his learned poeſie CONTEMNO ET ORNO, MENTE, MANV, <hi>I ſcorne and trimme, with minde, with hand.</hi> For ſurely this man was led with ſome heauenly ſpirit, which did ſo with-draw his minde from thoſe earthly cogitations, that he neuer tooke any thing in his life more vnkindly then when he was drawne from his bookes, which he alwaies preferred before all other things in the world beſide. Theſe great learned men follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were his familiar friends, and ſuch as he did greatly loue and reuerence. In Spain <hi>Benedictus Arias Montanus,</hi> that great linguiſt and graue Diuine; and the reuerend father <hi>Andrew Schotte,</hi> borne in Antwerp, a learned Ieſuite. In Italy, <hi>Fuluius Vrſinus, Franciſcus Superantius,</hi> and <hi>Iohannes Sambucus.</hi> In Germany, <hi>Gerard Mercator,</hi> that famous Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographer, <hi>Iames Monaw, Marke Velſer, Ioachim Chamberlin, Ionas Grutterus</hi> of Antwerp, and <hi>Arnold Milius.</hi> In France, <hi>Petrus Pithoeus,</hi> and others. In the Low-countries, <hi>Iuſtus Lipſius, Laeuinus Tormencius, Nicolaus Rockoxius, Cornelius Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Balthaſar Robianus, Ludouicus Perezius, Iohannes Brantius</hi> a ciuillian, recorder to the ſtate of Antwerp, <hi>Iohannes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> ſecretarie to the ſame city, <hi>Francis Raphalengius, Chriſtopher Plantine, Iohn Moret, Philip Gally, Otho Venius</hi> that famous painter, and <hi>Francis Sweert</hi> the yonger. In England, <hi>Humfrey Lloyd,</hi> the only learned courtiour of his time, and <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Camden,</hi> now Clarenceux, the painfull and iudicious antiquary of our land. With all theſe and many other he was familiarly acquainted. To theſe he wrot often, and from theſe he often receiued moſt kinde and louing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. He was a great ſtudent of antiquities, and ſearcher out of rare and ancient things. He had at home in his houſe, Images, Statues, Coines of Gold, Siluer and copper both of the Greeks, Romans and others: Shelfiſhes brought from India and our Antipodes: Marble of all kinde of colours: Torteiſes ſhelles of ſuch wonderfull big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that tenne men, ſitting round in a circle, might eate meat out of them at once: Others againe ſo little and narrow, that they were skarce ſo bigge as a pinnes head. His Library was ſo maruellouſly well ſtored with all ſort of Bookes, that his houſe might iuſtly haue beene termed, A ſhoppe of all manner of good learning, vnto which men flocked from diuers places, like as in former times they did to Plato's Academy, or Ariſtotle's Lyceum. This <hi>Erneſt</hi> and <hi>Albert,</hi> returning conquerour from the battaill at Hulſten, with other great Princes, and men of all ſorts, came in troops to ſee and behold. While he was thus buſied, and hauing now liued aboue threeskore and eleuen yeeres, he fell ſicke in Iune in the yeere of our Lord 1598, and growing euery day worſe and worſe, at length, he yeelded to nature and died vpon the 28 day of the ſame moneth. The Phyſicians affirmed that he died of an vlcer of the reines, which Hippocrates writeth will hardly euer be cured in old men. He was of ſtature tall and ſlender; the haire of his head and beard was of a yealow colour. His eies were gray, and his forehead broad. He was very courteous and affable. In ſerious buſineſſes he was very graue and ſober, but without any ſhew of arrogant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine: in mirth and ieſting he was as pleaſant, yet with that moderation, that all was guided by the rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian piety and modeſty. This deceaſed bachelour, Anna Ortell, a virgine his ſiſter, who liued not long after this her brother Abraham, (for ſhe died in the yeere of Grace 1600) cauſed to be buried and intombed in Saint Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaëls, the Abby of the Praemonſtratenſes in Antwerp. He might well want the honour of a gorgeous and coſtly tombe, who by the generall conſent of all men, had for his rare and ſingular vertues deſerued an euerlaſting fame and reputation. Francis Sweert, the yonger, gathered together the mournefull verſes of thoſe poets and friends of his, which did bewaile his death, ſet them foorth, and dedicated them to the State and citizens of Antwerp. Iuſtus Lipſius, at the inſtant requeſt of his heires, and for a perpetuall memoriall of their conſtant loue and friendſhip wrote that Epitaph which is in capitall letters ingrauen vpon his tombe.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing, that as I thinke, there is no man, gentle Reader, but knoweth what, and how great profit the knowledge of <hi>Hiſtories</hi> doth bring to thoſe which are ſerious ſtudents therein; I doe verily beleeue and perſwade myſelfe, that there is almoſt no man, be it that he haue made neuer ſo little an entrance into the ſame, and touched them neuer ſo lightly, that is ignorant how neceſſary, for the vnderſtanding of them aright, the knowledge of <hi>GEOGRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHY</hi> is, which, in that respect therefore is of ſome, and not without iuſt cauſe called <hi>The eye of Hiſtory.</hi> For thou ſhalt meet with many things in the reading of Hiſtories, (I will not ſay, almoſt all) which, except thou haue the knowledge of the countreys and places mentioned in them, cannot onely not bee well conceiued and vnderſtood, but alſo oft-times they are cleane miſtaken and otherwiſe vnderſtood then they ought to bee: which thing commeth to paſſe in many diſcourſes: but especially in the expeditions and voyages of great Kings, Captaines and Emperours: in the diuers and ſundry ſhiftings of Nations from one place to another: and in the traueils and peregrinations of famous men, made into ſundry countreys. But ſeeing that this is a matter which euen experience it ſelfe doeth teach vs to be true, there is no reaſon why I ſhould ſtand long vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the proofe of the ſame. This ſo neceſſary a knowledge of <hi>Geography,</hi> as many worthy and learned men haue teſtified, may very eaſily be learn'd out of <hi>Geographicall Chartes</hi> or Mappes. And when we haue acquainted our ſelues ſomewhat with the vſe of theſe <hi>Tables</hi> or Mappes, or haue attained thereby to ſome reaſonable knowledge of <hi>Geography,</hi> whatſoeuer we ſhall read, theſe <hi>Chartes</hi> being placed, as it were certaine glaſſes before our eyes, will the longer be kept in memory, and make the deeper impreſsion in vs: by which meanes it commeth to paſſe, that now we do ſeeme to perceiue ſome fruit of that which we haue read. I omit here, that the reading of <hi>Hiſtories</hi> doeth both ſeeme to be much more pleaſant, and in deed ſo it is, when the Mappe being layed before our eyes, we may behold things done, or places where they were done, as if they were at this time preſent and in doing. For how much we are holpen, when as in the Holy Scripture, we read of the iourney of the Iſraëlites, which they made from <hi>Egypt,</hi> through the Red ſea, and that ſame huge Wilderneſſe, into the Land of promiſe, when as looking vpon the Mappe of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> we doe almoſt aſwell ſee it as if we were there, I thinke any ſtudent in Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or that Hiſtory hath oft made triall. Which things being ſo, how much thoſe which are ſtudents and louers of <hi>Hiſtories</hi> are combred, hindred and ſtayd, yea, &amp; many times, euen while they are in their race and continued courſe, drawne backe, it is an eaſie matter to conceiue, when either the deſcription of all countreys cannot be gotten, or if they may be gotten, they are dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then that euery mans money will reach and attaine vnto especially thoſe that are but poore, or none of the wealthieſt. For there are many that are much delighted with <hi>Geography</hi> or <hi>Chorography,</hi> and especially with Mappes or Tables con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning the plotts and deſcriptions of Countreys, ſuch as there are many now adayes extant and euery where to be ſold: But becauſe that either they haue not that, that ſhould buy them: or if they haue ſo much as they are worth, yet they will not lay it out, they neglect them, neither do they any way ſatisfie themſelues. Others there are who when they haue that which will buy them, would very willingly lay out the money, were it not that by reaſon of the narrowneſſe of the roomes and places, broad and large Mappes cannot ſo be opened or ſpread, that euery thing in them may eaſily and well be ſeene and diſcern'd. For, that I may ſpeake that which is the trueth, thoſe great and large <hi>Geographicall</hi> Maps or Chartes, which are folded or rowl'd vp, are not ſo commodious: nor, when any thing is peraduenture read in them, ſo eaſie to be look'd vpon. And he that will in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hang them all along vpon a wall, had need haue not only a very large &amp; wide houſe, but euen a Princes gallery or ſpacious Theater. This I hauing oft made triall of, I began to bethinke my ſelfe, what meanes might be found to redreſſe theſe diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which I haue ſpoken of, and either to make them ſomewhat leſſe, or, if poſsibly it might bee, to take them all cleane away. And at length me thought it might be done by that meanes which we haue obſerued and ſet downe in this our booke, to which I earneſtly wiſh that euery ſtudent would affoord a place in his Library, amongst the reſt of his bookes.</p>
            <p>But that thou mayeſt the better vnderſtand, what it is that wee haue done in this our Theater, and what it is that thou muſt exſpect and looke for in the ſame; I thinke it not amiſſe in few wordes briefly here to declare vnto thee. First
<pb facs="tcp:23194:4"/> my purpoſe was to repreſent vnto thy view whatſoeuer heretofore thou had'ſt, or new haſt, in any <hi>Geographical</hi> or <hi>Choro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphicall</hi> Chartes here and there lately or long ſince ſet out that euer came to my handes, or were poſsibly to bee gotten for loue or money. Of all countreys whoſe deſcriptions are ſet out in <hi>Geographicall</hi> Tables, we haue ſelected one (for of ſome there are diuers) which in our iudgement ſeemed to bee the best and most exact: Which, notwithstanding that it were, by the first draught of the Authour ſomewhat large and broad, we haue brought into that ſmall forme, as might agree with this our worke, and that the whole Mappe might be contein'd in one leafe: or, which ſometime thou ſhalt obſerue we haue done, as thou may'st ſee, that in one leafe many might bee contein'd and expreſsed: yet ſo as nothing, no neuer ſo ſmall a thing, is either omitted or altered that was to bee found in the greater: except it be this, which oftentimes thou ſhalt finde, that the names of places and other things, which in the first Copies could hardly be read, in theſe our Mappes we haue ſo expreſsed, that they may perfectly be read of any man. And ſometime, where occaſion did ſerue, or need require, and the place would permit, vnto the moderne and vſuall names of certaine places, wee haue added the ancient names mentioned by old writers, but now vulgarly vnknowne. Which, as we doubt not, we haue done with the good-leaue and liking of the Authours themſelues: ſo I hope it will be a thing very well pleaſing to all ſuch as are readers and ſtudents of old Histories and Antiquities. In thoſe Mappes, which haue their Authours names written vpon them, we haue, as I ſaid, altered nothing at all, excepting two or three of the Marine tracts of the <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> which the Sea hath much changed ſince the time that their deſcriptions were first ſet foorth: As for examples ſake, in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> ouer against <hi>Zeland,</hi> not farre from the towne <hi>Wateruliet,</hi> where by the goodneſſe and great benefit of Almighty God, long after that the deſcription of this Countrey was first ſet out, the Maine-land was much enlarged and had gotten an aduantage of the Sea: wee there haue altered the forme of that Mappe, according as the place is found to be at this day. The deſcription of which plot of ground we obteined of Master <hi>Marke Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> the Lord and owner thereof, a braue gentleman, greatly renowmed both for the noble ſtocke from whence hee is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as alſo for his wiſdome and great experience. But in other Mappes, which had no name of the Authour ſubſcribed vnto them, we were ſomewhat more bold: for in theſe, in ſome places, at our diſcretion, where we thought good, wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſome-things, ſome-things we haue put out, and otherwhere, if it ſeemed to be neceſſary, we haue put in. Of ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys alſo, that we might, as much as in vs did lye, make vp our iust number and fill vp our ranke, we haue made ſome Mappes of our owne, that there might as few Mappes be wanting as poſsibly might be. In the abridgement and bringing of thoſe Mappes, which had as I ſaid the names of the Authours added vnto them into a leſſer forme, we haue vſed that faithfulneſſe and diligence, that we hope to deſerue thankes not onely of the Reader, but alſo euen of the Authours themſelues, or at least we haue dealt ſo in them, that no man need be aſham'd of theſe of ours whatſoeuer they be; yea he may aſwell acknowledge and take this little one of ours, for his owne, as that greater one first ſet out by himſelfe. For wee haue endeuoured to the vttermost of our power in this our worke, if it were poſsible, to deſerue thankes of the Authours, if not, yet by no meanes to displeaſe them: Not to follow or imitate that bad custome of ſome men in theſe our dayes, who, that they may ſeeme to the world to ſet foorth ſome new thing, doe nothing els but alter the workes and labours of other men, and oftentimes, out of thoſe which are good, to ſelect that which is not good, and to ſell it commonly for the best: Sometimes by adding ſomething at their pleaſure, and in ſome places againe taking out and detracting ſomething and withall either by concealing the right Authors names, or ſetting to their owne, or feyning a name of ſome one or other, they thinke to pleaſe the vulgar ſort with nouelties, that that their worke may ſell the better; and they may rake money together they care not how: For we were not mooued to vndertake this labour by any couetous deſire of getting much by it, but euen of a willing and forward minde that wee had to helpe and further thoſe that had a loue and affection to theſe ſtudies, not any whit respecting the gayning of any vaine glory and commendation by other mens labours. For what need we to make new Mappes, when as the old Mappes of other men, now extant, would ſerue our turne? Some there are peraduenture, which will looke to finde in this our Theater more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of particular Countreys, (for euery man naturally, for the loue that he beareth to his natiue ſoile, would, I doubt not, wiſh that it were here ſeuerally deſcribed amongſt the rest:) but let them know, that thoſe which are here miſsing, are not left out and omitted, either by our negligence, or for that we were lothe to be at that cost and charges: but becauſe that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we neuer ſaw any ſuch, or at leastwayes for that there neuer came any ſuch to our hands. If there be any man, which either hath any ſuch, or knoweth where there may be had, him we would earneſtly entreate, that he would be the meanes to helpe vs vnto them, aſſuredly promiſing him, that we will, at our owne coſt and charges, not without great thankes to him, and a moſt honourable mention of his name, cauſe them to be cut and imprinted apart and by themſelues, that hereafter they may be inſerted into this our Booke, either in their owne place, elſewhere, as any man ſhall like beſt.</p>
            <p>Of the Order alſo by vs here obſerued in the placing of theſe our Mappes, I thinke it not amiſſe, gentle Reader, to ſpeake a word or two, and to acquaint thee with our purpoſe: that if peraduenture there be any man, which doeth thinke that they ought to haue bene placed otherwiſe, we may either ſatisfie him, if we may, or els excuſe our ſelues, which is all, I thinke, that can be looked for at our hands. Firſt of all, we preſent vnto thy view an <hi>Vniuerſall Mappe</hi> of the whole world: Then, the foure quarters or principall parts of the ſame; to wit, <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America:</hi> in this following dame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which alwayes before the parts can be, the whole, whereof they be the parts, muſt of neceſsitie firſt be. Next after theſe we haue put the ſeuerall and <hi>particular Countreys</hi> of theſe parts, beginning at the Weſt part of the world, in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Ptolemey</hi> the Prince of Geographers, and almoſt all others that haue written of this argument: And ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces and <hi>particular countreys of America</hi> do firſt put foorth and ſhew themſelues: next to theſe do follow the <hi>Brittiſh Iles,</hi> after them <hi>Spaine,</hi> and then <hi>France.</hi> From hence we paſſe to <hi>Germany:</hi> whoſe Countreys being after our maner dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſurueyed, from <hi>Heluetia</hi> or <hi>Switzerland</hi> we paſſed ouer the Mountaines into <hi>Italy,</hi> which is the next countrey vnto it Eaſtward, purpoſing alſo to view all the Prouinces thereof ſeuerally. From thence we croſsed the Sea and ſayl'd into <hi>Greece.</hi> Whereupon going into <hi>Slauonia,</hi> we ſurueyed all the Countreys ſeuerally which do vulgarly ſpeake the Slauonian
<pb facs="tcp:23194:5"/> tongue, (to wit, <hi>Hungary, Tranſſyluania, Polonia, Scandia,</hi> and <hi>Ruſsia.</hi>) Thus hauing finiſhed <hi>Europe,</hi> we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> or Straight land, which is betweene the head of the Riuer <hi>Tanais</hi> and the North ſea, which is in deed the bound of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia:</hi> from it we ſtep into <hi>Aſia.</hi> Which, after we haue a while beheld, we left, and ſo paſſed into <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> by the Streights, or narrow piece of the Mainland, which runneth betweene the Bay of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the gulfe of <hi>Damiata, (Sirbonis lacus)</hi> made by the ouerflowing of the Midland-ſea. From thence paſsing through <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Barbary</hi> wee came vnto the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> which we croſſed, and at length came home againe to our owne natiue countrey from whence we first ſet foote; like vnto a trauailer or a Pilgrime, which hath viewed and trauailed through many and ſundry ſeuerall Nations and Countreys, paſsing out of one into another, orderly as they lay and were ſituate one by another, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skipping none, at last returneth ſafely and ioyfully from whence he first ſet foorth.</p>
            <p>Thus farre of the Mappes themſelues: Now let vs ſpeake a word or two of the backſide of the ſame. Becauſe we thought it would be a thing nothing pleaſing to the Reader or Beholder, to ſee the backeſides of the leaues altogether bare and empty we determined there to make a certaine briefe and ſhort declaration and Historicall diſcourſe of euery Mappe, in the ſame maner and order as we ſaid we obſerued in the Mappes themſelues; omitting nor concealing any mans name, that we had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to vſe. Moreouer to theſe alſo we haue added a Table of the names of all the Authours, that euer wee knew or had; out of which, thoſe that are ſo dispoſed, may fetch a more ample and larger diſcourſe and deſcription of the ſeuerall Countreys handled by them. Wherefore the ſtudents of <hi>Geography</hi> ſhall haue here, in the Authours thus named in order, and in the Catalogue of the Authours of the Geographicall Tables or Mappes, which we haue ſet before this our worke, and lastly in theſe Tables themſelues, a certaine ſhoppe, as it were, furniſhed with all kinde of instruments neceſſarily required in ſuch like buſineſſe: out of which, if peraduenture there may ſeeme any thing wanting, in his iudgement, either to the finiſhing of any Booke of that argument, or more fuller deſcriptions of any Countreys whatſoeuer, very eaſily, or in deed without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at all he may ſee, from whence it may by and by be fetched.</p>
            <p>Theſe things they are which I thought good to admoniſh the Reader of. It remaineth now, that wee doe entreate euery man, to take this our labour and entertaine it, with no other minde then it was by vs both begunne and finiſhed, and at length ſet out and Imprinted. Farewell, and wiſh well to <hi>Francis Hogenberg, Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe Arſen,</hi> by whoſe skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hands and extraordinary great paines and diligence almost all theſe Mappes were engrauen and cut.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hy <hi>Europe</hi> ſhould be ſo called, or who was the firſt Authour of this name, no man as yet hath found out; vnleſſe (ſayth <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his fourth booke) we ſhould thinke that the whole region borrowed this name from <hi>Europa</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Epyrus.</hi> This <hi>Plinie</hi> calleth the Nurſe of the victorious and conquering people of all other nations of the world, moſt beautifull and farre ſurpaſsing the reſt: and ſo it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times compared to <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> not for his greatneſſe and compaſſe, but for his might and power. Certaine it is, that this part, being moſt plentifully inhabited, is for multitude of nations inferiour to neither of the other. The North and Weſterne ſides hereof are bathed by the Ocean; the South coaſt is diſioyned from <hi>Africa</hi> by the Mediterranean ſea. Then Eaſtward by the Aegaean ſea (now called <hi>Archipelago</hi>) by the Euxin ſea (named at this preſent <hi>Mar Maggiore</hi>) by the lake of <hi>Maeotis</hi> (now termed <hi>Mar delle Zabacche</hi>) by the riuer Tanais (commonly called <hi>Don</hi>) and by the Iſthmus or ſtraight of the maine land, which is from the head or fountaine of this riuer directly vnto the North Ocean; it is diuided from <hi>Aſia,</hi> according to the opinion of <hi>Glarean.</hi> And thus it beares the ſhape of a Peninſula (which ſignifies a place of the earth almoſt diſioyned and cut from the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and ſo well neere on euery ſide enuironed with waters) as in the Table it ſelfe is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. The head hereof <hi>Rome,</hi> was whilome conquereſſe of the earth.</p>
            <p>The regions thereof (as they are now called) are <hi>Spaine, France, Germanie, Italie, Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonia, Greece, Hungarie, Poland</hi> with <hi>Lithuania, Moſcouia,</hi> or more ſignificantly <hi>Ruſsia;</hi> and that Peninſula which conteineth <hi>Norway, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Gotland.</hi> Among the Iſles thereof the firſt place is due to <hi>Britany</hi> conteining <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> then followes <hi>Ireland, Groenland, Friſland,</hi> and <hi>Iſland:</hi> all ſituate in the maine Ocean. In the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran ſea it hath <hi>Sicilia, Sardinia, Corſica, Candia, Maiorica, Minorica, Corfu, Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont;</hi> and others of leſſe note, the particular names and ſituations whereof are to be ſeene in the Table.</p>
            <p>This our <hi>Europe,</hi> beſides the Roman Empire reuerenced of all the world, hath in all (if you adde thoſe foureteene, which <hi>Damianus à Goes</hi> reckens vp only in <hi>Spaine</hi>) eight and twentie Chriſtian Kingdomes: whereby you may eſtimate the worthineſſe of this region. It is a place out of meaſure fruitfull: and the naturall diſpoſition of his aire is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry temperate. For all kindes of Graine, for Wine, and abundance of Woods, it is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to none, but comparable to the beſt of the others. It is ſo pleaſant, and ſo beautified with ſtately Cities, Townes and Villages, that for the courage and valour of the people and ſeuerall nations, although it be leſſe in quantitie and circuit, yet might it well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and indeed of all ancient Writers hath it euer beene accounted ſuperiour vnto the other parts of the World: moſt renowmed alſo hath it beene both in regard of the Macedonian Empire, and the great command and power of the Romans. The praiſes thereof you may reade in <hi>Strabo,</hi> who in his third booke, and ſeuen bookes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, hath moſt learnedly and excellently deſcribed it. Peruſe alſo other ancient Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographers. Of late Writers, amongſt other things by the way, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olateranus, Sebastian Munster, Dominicus Niger, Georgius Rithaimerus,</hi> in their Geographies, haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to paint it out in his colours. But <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Chriſtopher Cella</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmus</hi> his brother haue deſcribed it a part and by it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Diuers Iournals ouer all <hi>Europe</hi> in a maner, together with the diſtances of places, haue beene committed to writing by <hi>Cherubin Stella, John Herbacius,</hi> and <hi>George Mayerus.</hi> The like hath beene done by <hi>William Gratarolus</hi> in the end of his booke, which is entitled, <hi>De regimine iter agentium,</hi> or <hi>A direction for trauellers.</hi>

It is confined North by <hi>Libya;</hi> South by the Aethiopick Ocean; Weſt by <hi>Gualata;</hi> and Eaſt by the Kingdome of <hi>Gaoga.</hi> And here we are to note, that according to this their diuiſion all <hi>Africa</hi> is included within the Mediterran, Atlantick, and Aethiopick ſeas and the riuer <hi>Nilus;</hi> wherefore <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> are accounted parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which we notwithſtanding thinke more properly to belong to <hi>Africa:</hi> For the true <hi>Aethiopia</hi> containes at this day <hi>Presbyter Iohns</hi> Empire, which by all late Writers is aſcribed to <hi>Africa.</hi> We therefore with <hi>Ptolemey</hi> iudge that it ought to be bounded by the Mediterran and Ocean ſeas, rather than by any riuer whatſoeuer; and ſo it hath the forme of a Peninſula, being ioyned to <hi>Aſia</hi> by an Iſthmos or ſmall neck-land, which lies betweene the Mediterran ſea and the gulfe of <hi>Arabia.</hi> The South part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was vnknowen to our anceſtours, till the yeere 1497, whereas <hi>Vaſco de Gama</hi> firſt doubling the Cape <hi>de buona ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranza</hi> or <hi>of good hope,</hi> and ſailing about <hi>Africa,</hi> came to <hi>Calicut</hi> in <hi>East India.</hi> This Southern part by the Perſians and Arabians is called <hi>Zanzibar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the foreſayd Cape of good hope the inhabitants are exceeding blacke; which we thought in no wiſe to omit, becauſe all men ſuppoſe the cauſe of blackneſſe to be heat, and the neareneſſe of the Sunne; wheras here the Sunne ſcorcheth no more, than about the Streight of <hi>Magellan</hi> (if we meaſure the heat of the place, according to the poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heauens and diſtance from the Equinoctiall line) where notwithſtanding the people are reported to be maruellous white. But if we will needs aſcribe this blackneſſe to the ſcorching heat of the Sun, let vs conſider, what makes the Spaniards and Italians looke ſo white, whenas they are equally diſtant from the Equinoctiall with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the foreſayd Cape; namely the one towards the South, and the other towards the North. <hi>Presbyter Iohns</hi> people are of a browne colour; in <hi>Zeilan</hi> and <hi>Malabar</hi> the inhabitants are coale blacke, yet all in one &amp; the ſame diſtance from the aequator, and vnder the very ſame parallele of the heauens. * And on the contrary, why did <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> and <hi>Pindarus</hi> deſcribe ſuch as inhabited the ſame climate with themſelues, namely <hi>Colchis,</hi> to be of a blacke colour, and curled haire? <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his <hi>Thalia</hi> makes the Indians blacke like the Aethiopians: which the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our times confirmeth. I know <hi>Herodotus</hi> will haue the cauſe hereof to be the ſeed of the parents, which he ſayth is not white, as that of other people, but blacke. To whom <hi>Poſtellus</hi> alſo ſubſcribeth, and imputeth the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of this blackneſſe vnto <hi>Chams</hi> curſe. Againſt which opinion I haue nothing to allege. Let the trueth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſt vpon the authours credit. But this a man may thinke more ſtrange; that in all <hi>America</hi> there were no blacke people found beſides a few, only in one place called by them <hi>Quareca.</hi> What then is the efficient cauſe of this colour? Is it the drineſſe of the heauen, or of the earth? Is it perhaps ſome hidden propertie of the ſoile? Or a kind of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie inherent to the nature of men? Or is it all theſe vnited in one? But theſe things we leaue to be conſidered by them, who do more curiouſly ſearch into the ſecrets of nature.</p>
            <p>This portion of the world is called by the Greeks <hi>Libya,</hi> and by the Latines <hi>Africa,</hi> becauſe it is not moleſted with extremity of colde: or (if we may credit <hi>Ioſephus</hi>) from <hi>Afer</hi> one of <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie. Another deriuation of the name you haue ſet downe by <hi>Iohn Leo in the beginning of his firſt booke of the Deſcription of</hi> Africa, <hi>who deriueth it from the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick theme</hi> Faraka, <hi>ſignifying to diſioine or ſeparate; becauſe it is diſioyned from</hi> Europe <hi>by the Mediterran ſea; from</hi> Aſia, <hi>as he ſaith, by the riuer</hi> Nilus, <hi>or rather as the beſt authours haue taught, by the Arabian gulfe called of the Greeks</hi>

            </q>
            <p>Howbeit, that theſe verſes are not ancient, but grauen in our times; nor part of <hi>Sibylles</hi> Propheſies, but counterfait; I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed (being in hand with the ſecond edition of this my <hi>Theatrum</hi>) from <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Caeſar Orlando</hi> a Ciuilian, in his letters, out of ſome printed works of <hi>Gaſpar Varerius,</hi> in which ſince that I my ſelfe haue read the ſame. And afterward I found it confirmed by <hi>Amil. Reſende</hi> in his Antiquities of <hi>Portugale:</hi> namely, that in the time of <hi>Don Emmanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugale,</hi> one <hi>Hermes Caiado</hi> of the ſame countrey, cauſed them to be ingrauen and buried in the earth: and when he ſuppoſed that the marble began to corrupt with the moiſture of the ground; pretending ſome cauſe of recreation, he inuites his friends to a countrey-houſe of his, neere vnto which this fained Propheſie lay hid. Wherefore being all ſet at meat, in comes his Bailiffe with newes, that his Labourers had by chance digged vp a ſtone engrauen with letters. They all immediatly runne forth, they reade it, they admire it, they highly eſteeme it, and are ready to adore it, &amp;c. See how apt <hi>Caiado</hi> was to delude his friends. <hi>Marinaeus Siculus</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Spaine</hi> writes, that there was found in Gold-mines an ancient piece of coine with <hi>Augustus Caeſars</hi> image vpon it, and for the more confirmation of the matter, that it was ſent by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Conſance</hi> to the Pope. But I am of opinion, that it was there loſt by the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie which firſt found it. <hi>Ioſephus Acoſta</hi> in his booke <hi>De Natura noui orbis</hi> indeuours by many reaſons to proue, that this part of <hi>America</hi> was originally inhabited by certaine Indians, forced thither by tempeſtuous weather ouer the South ſea which now they call <hi>Mare del Zur.</hi> But to me it ſeemes more probable, out of the hiſtorie of the two <hi>Zeni,</hi> gentlemen of <hi>Venice</hi> (which I haue put downe before the Table of the South ſea, and before that of Scandia) that this New world many ages paſt was entred vpon by ſome iſlanders of <hi>Europe,</hi> as namely of <hi>Groenland, Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Friſland;</hi> being much neerer thereunto than the Indians, nor diſioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thence (as appeares out of the Map) by an Ocean ſo huge, and to the Indians ſo vnnauigable. Alſo, what elſe may we conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to be ſignified by this word <hi>Norumbega</hi> (the name of a North region of <hi>America</hi>) but that from <hi>Norway,</hi> ſignifying a North land, ſome Colonie in times paſt hath hither beene tranſplanted? But why in mine opinion the maine Ocean was neuer ſailed by ancient Nauigatours, I haue declared in my <hi>Theſaurus Geographicus,</hi> ſpeaking of OPHIR.</p>
            <p>All this part of the World, (except the North tract thereof, whoſe Coaſts are not yet diſcouered) hath in theſe laſt times beene ſailed round about. From North to South it ſtretcheth in forme of two Peninſulae or Demi-iſles, which are ſeuered by a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Iſthmos or neck-land. The Northermoſt of the two conteineth <hi>New Spaine,</hi> the prouince of <hi>Mexico,</hi> the countrey of <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>New-found-land.</hi> But the Southermoſt (which the Spaniards call <hi>Terra firma</hi>) containes <hi>Perú</hi> and <hi>Braſil.</hi> A deſcription of all which regions the ſtudious in Geography may reade in <hi>Leuinus Apolonius,</hi> in the Decads of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and in <hi>Maximilianus Tranſsiluanus,</hi> who writ all in Latine. Alſo to this purpoſe you haue many things worthy the obſeruation in the Ieſuites Epiſtles, and in <hi>Maffeius</hi> his ſtory of the Indies. <hi>Postellus</hi> alſo promiſeth Diſcourſes of Weſt-Indie-matters: and ſo doth <hi>Fredericus Furius Caeriolanus.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His ſea albeit vnknowen, yet was it not vnnamed by ancient writers: for <hi>Plinie</hi> calles it <hi>Ecum,</hi> and <hi>Oroſius Orientale,</hi> that is, The Eaſt ſea. <hi>Ptolemey</hi> falſly termes it SINVM MAGNVM, A great bay; whereas he ſhould haue nam'd it MARE MAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVM, A great ſea. For of all the ſeas in the world it is the greateſt and the wideſt. In <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> it is deſcribed vnder the name of <hi>Mare Cin, (that is, as I interpret it out of Nubienſis Arabs,</hi> Bahci'ltzni vel alkini, Mare Sinarum, <hi>The ſea of China</hi>) and in <hi>Haithon Armenus</hi> (whom elſwhere we more truly call <hi>Antonie Curchino</hi>) by the name of <hi>Mare Cathay.</hi> Well therefore might it be named by the ancient and middle-age writers; but neuer was it fully knowen and diſcouered, till <hi>Fernando Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> a Portugale ſailed thereupon. Seene it was indeed, and as it were ſaluted in the yeere 1513, by <hi>Vaſco Nunnez,</hi> from the coaſt of <hi>Perú.</hi> But <hi>Magellan</hi> in the yeere of our ſaluation 1520. hauing paſſed the ſtreight by him found, and called after his owne name (which it hitherto retaineth, for euery common Mariner calles it The Streight of <hi>Magellan</hi>) with an heroick and Herculean courage entred this ſea, which vncertaine it is, whether any ſhippe before his had euer ſtemmed. For meditating a voyage to the iſles of the <hi>Moluccos,</hi> whereunto the Portugals vſually ſailed from Weſt to Eaſt; and intending to make thither a ſhorter cut from Eaſt to Weſt, he came at length vnto them by this ſea: in one of which iſles called <hi>Machian,</hi> he was ſlaine in a skirmiſh. The courſe of his voyage was this: Departing from <hi>Siuil</hi> with fiue ſhips, whereof one being his owne, was called by a name of good preſage <hi>Victoria,</hi> he came to the fortunate or <hi>Canary-iſles;</hi> then to the <hi>Gorgones</hi> or <hi>Heſperides,</hi> now termed The iſles of <hi>Cape verde;</hi> and thence to the Streight abouenamed: which when he had found and paſt thorow, he enters into this ſea; where with a freſh and proſperous gale hauing ſailed vpon the maine 40. dayes together, and beholding nothing but ſea on all ſides, and ſtill the ſea; when he had croſſed the South tropick he deſcried two ſmall barren and vnhabited iſles: where notwithſtanding, becauſe they found good fiſhing, they ſtaied two dayes &amp; then departed, calling them the Vnfortunate iſles. Now, they are knowen by the name of <hi>Tuberones,</hi> and the iſles of <hi>S. Peter.</hi> Then he proceeds on his nauigation, &amp; in the ſpace of 3. moneths and 20. dayes, hauing ſailed ouer this vaſt Ocean 2400. leagues, he attained at length to the Aequinoctiall, and thence to the deſired <hi>Molucces.</hi> And becauſe (as we haue ſaid) he had for the moſt part a proſperous &amp; no tempeſtuous wind, he named this <hi>Pacificum</hi> or The peaceable ſea, now called by the common Mariner, The South ſea, or <hi>Mar del Sur.</hi> Thoſe that haue written of the New world, ſay, that this ſea about thoſe vnfortunate iſles, is moſt exceeding deepe, and that neere vnto the coaſt of <hi>Perú</hi> it yeeldeth pearles, and that there are in it 7449. iſles, ſo that ſome in our times not vnfitly haue called the Weſtern part thereof <hi>Archipelagus</hi> or A ſea thicke ſet with iſles: ſeeing this, like the Aegean ſea (which is planted all ouer with the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> the <hi>Sporades,</hi> and many other iſlands, and is called in the Italian tongue <hi>Archipelago</hi>) is alſo with iſles moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly repleniſhed. In the bottome of this ſea <hi>Francis Vlloa</hi> and <hi>Antonie Digafetta</hi> do report, that there growes a weed of 14. or 15. fathoms high within the water; and that it riſeth out of the water to the height of ſome 4. or 5. fathom: ſo that ſometimes you ſhall ſeeme not to ſaile thorow a ſea, but rather thorow a greene medow. The place of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his booke <hi>De Admirandis</hi> &amp;c. doth not much diſagree from this; where he writes of the Phoenicians which inhabited <hi>Gady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> that when they had ſailed a while without the pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> they arriued at certeine regions abounding with weeds and ſlime, which were ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the tides of the ſea. The very ſame affirmeth <hi>Iornandes</hi> in the beginning of his Getiſh hiſtory; where he writes, that none could ſaile thorow the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, being impaſſable in regard of weeds or turfs, and for that cauſe vnknowen. Yea <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi> out of <hi>Megaſthenes</hi> haue left recorded, that all the Eaſt Ocean growes full of woods. And that the ſea neere <hi>Portugale</hi> ſhould beare Okes laden with maſt, <hi>Polybius</hi> reporteth in <hi>Athenaeus.</hi> Alſo, that the Bay-tree growes in the Red ſea, the ſame authour affirmes vpon the credit of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> Hereunto you may adde that of <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his 4. booke of the hiſtory of Plants, <hi>cap.</hi> 7.8.9. and the teſtimony of <hi>Aelianus, lib,</hi> 13. <hi>de Animal. cap.</hi> 3. and <hi>Strabo, lib.</hi> 16. and <hi>Plinie, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 103. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. and <hi>lib.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. and <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his naturall queſtions concerning the face in the orbe of the Moone. All theſe are in ſome ſort confirmed by <hi>Platoes</hi> fables or hiſtories in his <hi>Timaeus</hi> concerning the iſle <hi>Atlantis;</hi> whoſe ſea he affirmes to be vnnauigable by reaſon of the ſlime or oaze remaining of the ſame iſles inundation. But concerning the ſhip called <hi>La Victoria</hi> learne thus much: it is not ſayd amiſſe: <hi>Bare names oft times things named doe reſemble:</hi> Manifeſt it is by this ſhip, which vnder this happy name, the firſt voyage that euer ſhe made, was the only ſhip that caried away the victory of ſailing quite ouer the maine Ocean, for ſo many ages before. For departing from <hi>Spaine,</hi> by the Streight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> to the <hi>Moluccos,</hi> thence hauing doubled the Cape of <hi>Buona Eſperança,</hi> and returned, whence ſhe firſt put forth, ſhe was the firſt of all ſhips and inall ages, that euer circumpaſſed the whole earth. The ſame ſhip made out of <hi>Spaine</hi> a ſecond voyage as farre as <hi>S. Domingo</hi> and home againe. Thither alſo ſhe made a third voyage; but in her returne ſhe was quite loſt; neither was it euer knowen what became of her. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity would haue thought ſhe had beene taken vp into the skies, and placed among the Conſtellations, like another <hi>Argo.</hi> Nor had this propheticall verſe of the peereleſſe Poet beene vnfitly alleged in her commendation: <hi>Then comes another</hi> Tiphys, <hi>another gold-fleeced</hi> Argo. Let <hi>Plinie</hi> now ceaſe to maruell, that out of a ſmall hemp-ſeed ſhould grow that, which was of force to cary vp and downe the globe of [his] earth. We in our age haue ſeene with the very ſame thing this world of [ours, much greater than his] nauigated round about. Ours, I ſay: which that you may more perfectly vnderſtand, do but compare the firſt Table of our Theatre with the firſt of our Parergon or By-worke, and you ſhall ſee the difference.</p>
            <p>And here, I ſuppoſe, I ſhall not beſtow my labour altogether in vaine, by adding certaine particulars not commonly knowen, concerning the firſt diſcouery hereof. Which by all our late Writers is not vnworthily aſcribed to <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus.</hi> For in the yere 1492, he was the firſt man that laid it open, &amp; made it knowen, and communicated the vſe and benefit thereof to the Chriſtian world. Howbeit I finde, that the North part of <hi>America</hi> (which lieth neereſt vnto <hi>Europe,</hi> and to ſome of our European iſles, namely, <hi>Groenland, Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Friſland;</hi> and is called <hi>Eſtotiland</hi>) was long ſince diſcouered by certaine Friſlandiſh fiſhers, driuen by tempeſt vpon that coaſt: and afterward about the yere 1390, that it was reuiſited anew by <hi>Antonie Zeno,</hi> a gentleman of <hi>Venice:</hi> and that by the authority of <hi>Zichmi,</hi> then King of the ſaid iſle of <hi>Friſland,</hi> a Prince in thoſe times very valiant, and ouer all that ſea, for his warres and victories moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed. Concerning this his expedition there are extant in Italian certaine Collections or briefe extracts drawen by <hi>Francis Marcolino</hi> out of the letters of <hi>Nicolas</hi> and <hi>Antonie Zeno</hi> gentlemen of <hi>Venice,</hi> who liued in theſe parts. Out of which Collections I adde this that followes touching the deſcription of this region. <hi>Eſtotiland</hi> (he ſaith) abounds with all things neceſſary for mankind. In the mids therof ſtands an exceeding high mountaine,<note place="margin">That you many bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this relation, peruſe our Table of <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>
               </note> from whence iſſue foure riuers that water the whole country. The inhabitants are witty, and moſt expert in all kind of handicrafts. A language and letters they haue peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Howbeit in this Kings Library there are certeine Latine books, no whit vnderſtood by them, which might perhaps before that time be there left by ſome of their European neighbors that had traffique with them. They haue all kinds of mettall, but ſpecially gold, wherewith they mightily abound. They exerciſe trade of merchandize with the people of <hi>Greenland;</hi> from whence they fetch hides, pitch, &amp; brimſtone. The inhabitants ſay, that towards the South there are countries rich of gold, and repleniſht with inhabitants. There are alſo many &amp; great woods; out of which they haue matter for the building of their ſhips and cities; whereof and of fortreſſes there are great numbers. Of the loadſtones vſe in nauigation they are vtterly ignorant. They alſo make mention of <hi>Drogeo,</hi> a region toward the South, inhabited by Canibals, and ſuch as are delighted to eat mans fleſh; for want whereof, they liue with fiſhing, which they very much vſe. Beyond this there are large countries and another New world; but the inhabitants are barbarous, and go naked: howbeit againſt the cold of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they arme themſelues with beaſts skinnes. Theſe haue no kind of mettall: they liue by hunting. For weapons they vſe long and ſharp-pointed ſtaues and bowes. They make warres one vpon another. Gouernours they haue, and lawes wherto they yeeld obedience. Southward of this place they liue in a more temperate climate, hauing cities and idol-temples, wherin they ſacrifice liuing men, whoſe fleſh they afterward deuoure. Theſe haue the vſe of gold and ſiluer. Thus much concerning this tract of land, out of the foreſaid collections or extracts; wherein this alſo is worthy the obſeruation, that euen then our Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Pilots by meanes of the loadſtone ſailed thoſe ſeas. For I am of opinion, that there is not to be found in any hiſtory a more ancient teſtimony touching the foreſayd vſe of this ſtone. And theſe things I was the willinger to adioyne to this Table, becauſe I ſee none of them that haue written the hiſtories of the world ſo much as once mention this matter.</p>
            <p>But concerning the loadſtone or ſea-compaſſe you are to vnderſtand, that the firſt inuentour therof was <hi>Iohn Goia</hi> a citizen of <hi>Melfi,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander Sardus</hi> in his booke <hi>De inuentoribus rerum</hi> calleth <hi>Flauius Campanus.</hi> For ſo write the Italians, and ſo much is confirmed by <hi>Antonie Panormitanus</hi> in this one verſe of his: <hi>Firſt</hi> Melfi <hi>Sailors taught, the loadſtone how to vſe,</hi> and that in the yere of our Sauior 1300. This <hi>Melfi</hi> called <hi>Amalphis</hi> in Latine, is a towne ſituate vpon the ſea-ſhore of <hi>Lucania. Goropius</hi> aſcribes the finding out of this ſecret to our Danes or Dutchmen; being perſuaded hereunto, becauſe the names of the 32. winds written vpon the compaſſe, are by all Pilots and Mariners, be they French, Spaniards, or of what nation ſoeuer, expreſſed in the Dutch tongue: which I confeſſe to be true, if you except the Italians only: for they both write and ſpeake of theſe winds in their owne mother-language. Howbeit ſeeing all our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigatours of <hi>Europe,</hi> be they Spaniards, French, Engliſh, or Dutch, do expreſſe them in our language, I am verily of opinion, that as it was firſt found and vſed by the Amalfitans or Italians eſpecially within their owne Mediterran ſea: ſo was the knowledge therof from them deriued vnto our Netherlanders, and moſt of all to thoſe of <hi>Bruges;</hi> whoſe city at that time (before all traff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Prouince was about the yeere 1518 forcibly ſubdued to the Spaniſh gouernment, vnder the command and conduct of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Corlez:</hi> who with the great ſlaughter of his owne people, but farre greater of the inhabitants fighting for their liberty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the ſame. It is a region rich of ſiluer and golde: for it hath very many riuers yeelding ſands or graines of perfect gold. Vpon the coaſt of this countrey are many commodious fiſhings for pearle. Salt lakes here are diuers, the water whereof through the heat of the Sunne is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into excellent ſalt. Here is great abundance of <hi>Caſsia fiſtula,</hi> and a kind of fruit in the Mexican language called <hi>Cacao,</hi> ſomewhat reſembling an Almond: which is with them very highly eſteemed; for hereof they make a kinde of drinke, to their owne taſte moſt delicate. The ſeas and riuers belonging to this countrey abound mightily with fiſh. Their riuers alſo breed Crocodiles, whoſe fleſh is food to the inhabitants. In theſe places this creature is for the moſt part aboue twenty foot long. It is a countrey very mountainous and beſet here and there with moſt lofty and cragged rocks. So great is the diuerſity of languages in theſe regions, that one cannot vnderſtand another without an Interpreter. The principall Colonies to be ſeene in this Table, which in <hi>New Spaine</hi> haue been planted by the Spaniards, are firſt <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> the ſeat of a Biſhop, and of one of the Kings counſels. <hi>Colima,</hi> by another name called the city of the Purification. <hi>Guadalajara,</hi> a towne moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and head of the Kingdome of <hi>New Gallicia. Mechoacan,</hi> a Biſhops ſea alſo. <hi>Sacatula,</hi> the city of Angels, a mother-towne and a Biſhoprick. <hi>Mexico,</hi> a Kingly city, or rather Queene of all the cities in the New world; ſituate vpon the banke of a lake, or rather of a fenne: yea the very ground-plot of this city is ſo fenny, that you cannot come thither, nor depart thence but ouer bridges and cawſeys. The lake adioyning is ſalt, being ſix leagues long and fiue broad. Fiſhes it hath none, but very ſmall ones; which more aptly may be called wormes than fiſhes: of whoſe putrefaction, which is there cauſed by the heat of Summer, the aire is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo infected, that it is moſt vnholeſome dwelling there: yet is it as much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented with inhabitants and merchants, as any mart-towne in <hi>Europe.</hi> It is a large city; for in compaſſe it containeth about three leagues. The other lake adioining to this, is freſh water, and very plentifull of fiſh; wherein alſo ſtand many townes. There are likewiſe a great number vpon the banks of either lake. In this city (as <hi>Ierome Giraua</hi> reporteth) there was by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third eſtabliſhed the ſeat of an Archbiſhop, in the yeere 1547.</p>
            <p>This citie was taken by the Spaniards 140 yeeres after the firſt foundation thereof; <hi>Montezuma</hi> at the ſame time being King, the ninth in number.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Iſland of <hi>Cuba</hi> is ſo called by the naturall inhabitants; but by the Spaniards <hi>Fernandina,</hi> and <hi>Joanna;</hi> and (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> reports) <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega.</hi> In length it extendeth Eaſt and Weſt 300 Spaniſh leagues: containing in bredth fifteene, and in ſome places twenty of the ſaid leagues. The land is very moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, but rich of gold, and excellent copper. Madder, which the Apothecaries, becauſe it is very apt to die wooll and leather, call Diers-madder, is heere found in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. It is in all places beautified with thicke woods, with riuers and pooles of freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: albeit there are lakes naturally ſalt. The woods breed vp Hogges and Kine in great plentie: the riuers ſometimes yeeld graines of gold. It containes ſix colonies or townes of Spaniards: the principall whereof called <hi>Sant Jago,</hi> is the ſeat of a Biſhop. But <hi>Hauana</hi> is the chiefe mart and hauen towne of all the Iſle. Two wonderfull things <hi>Gonſaluo de Ouie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> deſcribes in this Iſle: one, a valley extended betweene two mountaines ſome three Spaniſh miles in length: (the Ancients would haue named it, as in <hi>Gallia Narbonenſi,</hi> now called <hi>Prouence, The ſtony field</hi>) which bringeth forth round ſtones in ſo great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that a man may lade whole ſhippes with them, being by nature framed ſo exactly round, that no Turner can amend them. The other is a mountaine not farre from the ſea, whereout iſſueth a kind of Bitumen or Pitch in ſo great a quantity, that it runnes into the ſea, and there floats farre and wide, according as it is carried by the waues or windes. This Pitch, they ſay, is very commodious for the calcking and braying of ſhips.</p>
               <p>HISPANIOLA lies to the Eaſt of <hi>Cuba.</hi> This Iſle by the firſt inhabitants was called <hi>Quiſquaeia,</hi> afterwards <hi>Haiti,</hi> and <hi>Cipanga</hi> likewiſe. But the Spaniards name it <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaniola,</hi> and (of the principall city) <hi>San Domingo.</hi> The compaſſe hereof is 350 leagues. It is an Iſle rich in Sugar, and it hath many Gold-mines. It is very ſtrange that is reported concerning a little flie very common in this Iſland, called by the inhabitants <hi>Cucujo,</hi> and as big almoſt as one of the ioynts of a mans finger, hauing foure wings, two very thin, and the other two greater and harder, wherewith the thin ones are couered. This ſhineth in the night as glowe-wormes doe with vs. The force of this light is not only in his eyes, ſparckling like fire, but alſo in his ſides, ſo that by lifting vp his wings, he ſhines more fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than when he lies ſtill. By the naturall curteſie of this little creature, all their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they ſay, are ſo lightſome euen in the darkeſt nights, that a man may reade and write very plainly without the helpe of any other light. This light of theirs is augmented by their number; ſo that many will giue a greater light than a few. Whoſo deſ res a larger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of theſe Iſlands, let him reade the hiſtory of the New world written by <hi>Jerome Benzo, Peter Martyr</hi> his Decads of Iſlands lately diſcouered, and other writers of <hi>America.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Spaniards diuide the South part of <hi>America</hi> into fiue regions, namely, <hi>The golden Caſtilia, Popaian, Perú, Chili,</hi> and <hi>Braſil. Perú</hi> in times paſt before the Spaniards comming thither was much larger, vnder the gouernment of the Ingas, than at this preſent, as <hi>Giraua</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers write. Now they confine it with <hi>Quito</hi> on the North, and with <hi>Puerto de Plata</hi> on the South. It was thus named from a riuer &amp; hauen named <hi>Perú.</hi> At this preſent they diuide it, according to the ſituation thereof, into three parts; into <hi>Sierras, Andes,</hi> and <hi>Plaines.</hi> The plaine countrey they call that which lieth next the ſea; <hi>Sierras</hi> are the mountaines; and <hi>Andes</hi> a region beyond the mountaines toward the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>The head-city of this countrey of <hi>Perú</hi> is <hi>Lima,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>La ciadad de les Reges,</hi> where the Kings ſeat, and the Chancerie of the whole Kingdome remaines. Alſo it is the ſea of an Archbiſhop, who vnder his iuriſdiction hath theſe Biſhopricks following; <hi>Quito, Cuſco, Guamanga, Arequipa, Paz, Plata, Trugillo, Guanuco, Chacapoia, Puerto viejo, Guajaquil, Popajan, Charchi, S. Michael,</hi> and <hi>S. Francis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is the richeſt of golde of all the countreys in the world, beſides many other, theſe few arguments do euidently demonſtrate. <hi>Francis Xeres</hi> writeth, that in <hi>Cuſco</hi> there were houſes, whoſe pauement, walles &amp; roofes were couered quite ouer with plates of golde. <hi>Giraua</hi> reports, that the inhabitants of the prouince <hi>Ancerna</hi> go to warres all armed in gold from head to foot: their habergions, their breſt-plates, their leg &amp; thigh harneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt wholly of gold. The ſame authour affirmes, that out of certeine gold-mines neere <hi>Quito</hi> is digged more gold than earth. Thoſe that haue written the ſtorie of King <hi>Atabalipa,</hi> do agree in this, that he offered ſo much golde to the Spaniards for his ranſome, as the roome wherein he was priſoner would containe. It was two and twenty foot long, and ſeuenteene foot broad: this he offered to fill ſo high as he could reach vpon the wall with his longeſt finger; or if they thought better (marke alſo the infinite quantitie of ſiluer in this region) he offered to fill it twiſe with ſiluer euen to the very roofe. It is alſo recorded, that the Spaniards at their firſt entrance vpon this countrey, ſhod their horſes with gold and ſiluer ſhoes.</p>

By the inhabitants it was named <hi>Iaquaſa.</hi> The French haue more than once attempted to plant a colony here: but hitherto they were neuer able in regard of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards ill will, who oft expelled them from thence. It is inhabited by a ſauage, forlorne, and beaſtly people. They liue vpon ſpiders, ants, lizards, ſerpents, and other venimous, and creeping things. The region is very fruitfull, and rich of gold. Concerning this country <hi>Iames Cole</hi> my nephew from the mouth of an eie-witneſſe (as he ſaith) writes vnto me as followeth: The inhabitants are of a browniſh colour; but the Kings wiues are blacke by a kind of arte. The King hath power to giue, or rather to ſell wiues to ſuch as are deſirous to marrie. A married woman being taken in adultery, ſhe is for her incontinency from morning till night bound with her backe to a tree, her armes and legs ſtretched abroad, and ſometimes ſhe is beaten with rods. Their women within three houres after they are deliuered of childe, carry forth their infants, and waſh them in the riuer. They haue no hatchets, nor ſpades, but of ſtone. In ſtead of ploughes, they haue certaine woodden pickaxes, wherewith they open the ground, and ſowe a kinde of graine commonly called Turkiſh or Ginny-wheat, whereof they haue yeerely two or three crops. They haue alſo Pheaſants, &amp;c. They ſowe in the moneths of May, Iune, and Iuly; and reape within ſix weeks after. Concerning this region reade the booke of <hi>Iaques Morguez le moine.</hi>

            <p>The firſt <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> which ſeated themſelues heere not long after the vniuerſall Flood and Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> came hither from <hi>France,</hi> as by Neereneſſe of place, Likeneſſe of language, Maners, Gouernment, Cuſtomes &amp; Name is by the learned <hi>Clarencieux Camden,</hi> the onely light of our hiſtories, in that his thriſe renowned <hi>Britannia,</hi> euidently demonſtrated.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>COTLAND, the North part of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> anciently called <hi>Albanie,</hi> and is of the firſt inhabitants, (which they call the wilde Scots, and dwell more in within the land, retaining yet the old language,) at this day cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Albaine,</hi> was formerly called of the Romanes, <hi>Britannia minor</hi> and <hi>ſecunda,</hi> as <hi>Lhoyd</hi> doth gather out of <hi>Sextus Rufus.</hi> This country is diuided into 2. parts, by the rough &amp; craggy mount <hi>Grampius,</hi> (now <hi>Grantz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>been</hi>) whereof <hi>Tacitus</hi> maketh mention. For it begining at the German ocean, neere the mouth of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Dee,</hi> coaſting along by <hi>Aberden,</hi> through the middeſt of the country toward the Iriſh-ſea, ſtaieth at the lake <hi>Loumond.</hi> This Mountaine was ſometime the bound of the kingdome of the Pictes and Scottes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> is fuller of mountaines and more barren then <hi>England:</hi> Yet euery where it hath many commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ports and hauens. For ſo is this country embraced of the armes of the ſea, that there is no houſe in it, as <hi>Iohn Maior</hi> affirmeth, which is aboue twentie leagues diſtant from the ſalt water. In the vallies are Lakes, meeres, pooles, riuers and fountaines well ſtored with ſundrie ſorts of fiſh. In the mountaines are champion plaines, yeelding great ſtore of paſture for cattell, and woods abounding with plenty of Deere. By the meanes of which commodities it hath been ſo maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that hitherto it might neuer be wholly conquered: For in any eminent danger they preſentlie flie to the woods and bogges, for ſuccour and refuge, where they haue of veniſon and fiſh ſufficient ſtore for prouiſion of victuall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> hath many wonders, whereof ſome we haue heere ſet downe out of <hi>Hector Boëthus.</hi> In <hi>Galloway</hi> ſaith he, is a lake called <hi>Myrtoun,</hi> part of whoſe water in the winter freezeth as other waters do, the other part was neuer knowne to haue beene frozen in the greateſt froſts that euer were. In the country of <hi>Carict</hi> there are very great and large Oxen, whoſe fleſh is verie tender and of a pleaſant and delicat taſt: Beſides that, the fatte neuer waxeth hard, but is alway thinne in the manner of liquid oile. The Sea that waſheth the coaſt of this prouince, is very rich of oiſters, herrings, congers, cockels, and other ſuch like fiſhes. In the prouince of <hi>Coyl</hi> about ten miles from the towne <hi>Aër,</hi> is a Stone, hardly twelue foot high, of 33. cubites thicke, called of the inhabitants, <hi>The deafe ſtone:</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you ſhall make neuer ſo great a noiſe, nay if one ſhall ſhoote off a peece of ordinance on the one ſide, it ſhall hardly be heard on the other ſide, except one bee a good way off from it, for then the ſound may eaſily be perceiued. In <hi>Lennox,</hi> which <hi>Ptolemey</hi> calleth <hi>Lelgouia, (Lelannonia,</hi> as I conceiue out of <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> but I thinke our authour meant <hi>Selgouiae,</hi> which is farre from this place) there is a very great lake, which they call <hi>Loumond,</hi> aboue twenty foure miles long, and eight miles broad; It conteineth thirtie Ilands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diuers haue villages well inhabited, with Churches and Chappels dedicated to the ſeruice of Almighty God. In this three things are eſpecially worth the obſeruation. For the fiſhes there, moſt wholeſome and good, haue no ſinnes. The water oft times, when the winds are moſt calme and ſtill, is ſo boiſterous and rough, that it affraieth the beſt experienced watermen from putting forth to croſſe the ſame: For the wind being alaied the boates are taken in their midde-courſe, and are toſſed with ſuch danger, that except ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious hauen ſhall fortune to be neere hand, many times they are ouerturned and caſt away. Laſtly, there is an iland in it, very good paſture for the feeding of cattell, which ſwimmeth and moueth euery way as the winds driue. It is credibly reported, that there is a ſtone which groweth in <hi>Argadia (Argathelia</hi> or <hi>Argile</hi>) which if it be couered but a while with ſtraw or flax, it will ſet it on fire. At <hi>Slanis,</hi> a caſtle in <hi>Buquhan,</hi> there is a caue of a ſtrange nature. For the water that droppeth into it in continuance of time is turned into a very white ſtone; and if within a certaine number of yeares they ſhould not be taken out, it would haue been long ſince filled vp with them. In this prouince there is no ratte euer ſeene; and if ſo be that any ſhould be brought in thither, it will not by any meanes liue there. In the countrie of <hi>Fife</hi> great ſtore of a kind of blacke ſtone is digged out of the earth, (we call it ſea-coale) a moſt excellent kind of fuell. At the mouth of the riuer <hi>Forth,</hi> in the maine ſea there is a very high rocke, out of whoſe toppe a ſpring of freſh water, (a great miracle of nature) doth runne abundantlie. About two miles diſtant from <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> is a ſpring, vpon the toppe of whoſe water, dropps of oile, do continually ſwimme, in ſuch ſort, that if you take none from off it, there will be neuer the more: and if you take ought from thence, there will be neuer the leſſe. This oile is good againſt the roughneſſe of the skinne. Thus farre of the ſtrange thinges of this Realme. <hi>Scotland</hi> in the countrie of <hi>Driſdaile</hi> hath a mine of <hi>Gold,</hi> in the which alſo is found that which they commonly call <hi>Lazure.</hi> It hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo mines both of Iron and Lead.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants which poſſeſſe the South part, on this ſide the mount <hi>Grampius,</hi> are more ciuill and humane: and do ſpeake the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tongue. Thoſe which dwell in the North parts, are a rough and more hard kind of people (they call them The wild-Scottes) and do weare mantles and skirts died with Saffron after the Iriſh faſhion, and go barelegged. They ſpeake the Iriſh tongue. And as the Language of <hi>Scotland</hi> is of two ſorts, ſo are their maners as diuers. Theſe <hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> calleth High-land-men, the other, I meane the wild-Scottes, they call Low-land-men.</p>
            <p>The chiefe city of <hi>Scotland</hi> is <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> there is the kings ſeat, and the caſtle of Maidens, often mentioned in hiſtories. Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,</hi> and <hi>Aberdon</hi> are two Vniuerſities. The city <hi>Glaſow</hi> is the Archbiſhops ſea. The towne of <hi>Perth,</hi> commonly called S. <hi>Iohns-toun,</hi> is the onely towne in <hi>Scotland</hi> that is walled about. Of the wood <hi>Caledon,</hi> (whereof <hi>Ptolemey</hi> and other ancient writers haue recorded.) There is ſcarcely any mention to be found, onely about the towne of <hi>Sterling,</hi> there remaineth ſome ſhew of the name. Thus farre of the kingdome of <hi>Scotland:</hi> now it will not be amiſſe to ſpeake ſomewhat of the ilands, that lie round about the ſame, and do belong vnto that crowne.</p>
            <p>The HEBRIDES, (commonly called the <hi>Weſt-iles,</hi>) both for bigneſſe and number do excell the reſt. <hi>Hector Boëthus</hi> ſaith that they be in number 43. But heere he reckoneth vp the ile of <hi>Man</hi> as one of them, which is not ſubiect to the kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the allegeance of the King of <hi>England;</hi> neither do I thinke that it was euer accounted of the ancients among the <hi>Hebrides.</hi> The firſt of the <hi>Hebrides</hi> is <hi>Aran,</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Boëth</hi>) then <hi>Hellaw</hi> and <hi>Rothes.</hi> Not farre from theſe is <hi>Alize,</hi> where are great plenty of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, which they call <hi>Soland-geeſe</hi> The greateſt of all and the moſt famous is <hi>Ile,</hi> a fertile ſoile for corne, and rich for veines of mettall. Then <hi>Cumber</hi> and <hi>Mule.</hi> Neere vnto theſe is <hi>Ione,</hi> memorable for the tombs of Kings long ſince buried there. Next vnto this is <hi>Lewis,</hi> laſt of all is <hi>Hirth</hi> ſituate in the 43. degree of latitude. Thus <hi>Boethus</hi> calleth them. But <hi>Iohn Maior</hi> the Scot nameth them thus, <hi>Argila, Aranea, Awyna, Butha,</hi> or <hi>Rothſaya,</hi> and <hi>Leuiſora.</hi> In theſe ilands are thoſe geeſe, which they call <hi>Clakes, (Gyraldus</hi> calleth them <hi>Berna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>) which <hi>Boëthus</hi> affirmeth to breed of the ſea and of rotten wood; and not to grow vpon trees, as the common ſort beleeue and haue publiſhed in their writings. For if you ſhall caſt, ſaith he, a peece of wood into that ſea, in continuance of time, firſt wormes do breed within the wood, which by little and little become to haue heads, feet &amp; wings: at the laſt being fledge and growen to their full growth, to the bignes of a gooſe, they attempt to flie, and do ſomtimes ſwim and ſometimes vſe their wings as other Sea-foule do. Beyond the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> are the ORCHADES, (or the <hi>Orkeney iles,</hi>) of which the beſt is <hi>Pomona,</hi> famous for the Biſhops-ſea, a goodly Church, and two ſtrong caſtles. One of theſe <hi>Iohn Maior</hi> calleth <hi>Zeland,</hi> which is 50. miles in length. In theſe grow no manner of trees, nor any wheat, and yet otherwiſe of all other ſorts of graine they are very fertile. It breedeth no ſerpent or venimous beaſt. In <hi>Scotland</hi> they buy the barrell'd butter: the inhabitants hauing abundance of Barley whereof they make a moſt ſtrong kind of drinke, and are very great drinkers; yet, as <hi>Boëthus</hi> ſaith, you ſhall neuer ſee a drunken-man, or madde man, one beſtraught or a naturall foole amongſt them. The ſame authour affirmeth the like of the inhabitants of the iles of <hi>Scetland:</hi> but this is no wonder, amongſt them that drinke nought but water. All the wealth and commodities of theſe Scetland-men conſiſt in Stockfiſh, and hides of beaſtes. In the <hi>Hebrides</hi> they vſe the Iriſh tongue: in the iles of <hi>Orkeney</hi> they ſpeake the Gottiſh language. M. <hi>Iordanus</hi> in his mappe of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Orchades</hi> are ſubiect to the kingdome of <hi>Denmarke:</hi> yet we know them to belong to <hi>Scotland</hi> vnder the title of a Dukedome. But ſe what we haue written of this in the diſcourſe to the mappe of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> Of <hi>Scotland</hi> and of the ilands adioining thou maiſt read more at large in <hi>Hector Boëthus, Iohn Maior,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Liſley,</hi> Scottiſh-men which haue written the hiſtories of this their country.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He South part of the Iland of <hi>Britaine,</hi> is, as we haue ſaid before, diuided into two parts. That part which is toward the Eaſt, abutting vpon the German Ocean, is of the Angles, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Saxons which ſeated themſelues there, in their language called ANGLIA, or <hi>England,</hi> that is, the Angles land. The Weſt part, which is ſeuered from that other by the riuers <hi>Seuern</hi> and <hi>Dee,</hi> and doth vſe the ancient Brittiſh tongue, is of the ſame Angles or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen called, WALLIA or <hi>Wales:</hi> yet the Brittan or Welſhman calleth himſelfe <hi>Cumro;</hi> and his country <hi>Cumria;</hi> the Engliſh <hi>Saiſſons;</hi> and their country, <hi>Lhoëgria:</hi> neither do they know, or at leaſt they will not acknowledge, what <hi>England</hi> or an Engliſhman doth meane: So great difference there is betweene the languages of the ſeuerall nations of this Iland.</p>
            <p>All this South part, <hi>England,</hi> I meane, and <hi>Wales,</hi> hath their proper king, vnto whom many Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Barons and great Noblemen are ſubiect and obedient. It is a countrie at all times of the yeare moſt kind and temperate. The Aire is thicke, and ſo it is much ſubiect to windes, clowdes and raine: and therefore in regard of thickneſſe of the aire it is neither oppreſt with too much heat or too much cold. For it is found true by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that although it be more Northerly than <hi>Brabant, Flanders,</hi> and other forrein countries, yet heere the winter is neuer ſo bitter nor the froſt ſo eger as in thoſe parts. It hath euerie where many hilles, (without wood and water,) which notwithſtanding do bring forth very ſmall and ſhort graſſe, an excellent feed for ſheepe: and therefore infinite flockes of ſheepe do beſpread them, which either by reaſon of the kindneſſe of the aire, or goodneſſe of the ſoile, do yeeld moſt ſoft wooll farre finer than thoſe of other countries. And for that this country breedeth neither woolues nor any rauenous beaſt, you ſhall ſee in diuers places flocks of ſheepe vpon the hilles, and dales, greene paſtures, commons, fallowes, and corne fields; into which after the crop is off, euery man, by a certaine ancient cuſtome doth put in his cattell in common, to wander heere and there without a ſhepheard. This indeed is that <hi>Golden fleece,</hi> in which eſpecially the riches of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants doth conſiſt: for an huge maſſe of gold and ſiluer, is by Merchants, which thither flocke from all quarters for ſuch like wares, yearly brought into the Iland, and there doth continually reſt, for that it is by proclamation forbidden that no man may carry any money out of the Realme. It aboundeth alſo with all ſorts of cattell, except aſſes, mules, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and elephants. There is in no place of the world greater and larger dogges, nor better.</p>
            <p>The ſoile is very fatte and fertile, and naturally bringeth foorth, beſide all ſorts of corne and pulſe, all maner of things, onely the firre-tree, and, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith, the beech tree, although that now it hath in diuerſe places plenty of beeches. The ay-green Bay tree doth in theſe Northren countries no where thriue better. Such abundance of Roſemary heere doth grow in all places and that ſo high, that they oft times do fence their gardens therewith. Wine they haue none, for the grapes ſeldome heere do ripen, and is amongſt them planted rather for ſhade and pleaſure, then for his fruit and profit. There is in no country in Chriſtendome more Crowes than heere, a kind of fowle very harmefull: for it doth not onely ſpoile the ripe and ſtanding corne, but aſſoone as it is ſhotte they will ſtocke and digge it vp with their billes, ſo that the husbandmen are faine at that time of the yeare to ſet Boies in the fields with bow and arrowes (for they are not afraid of mens voices) to skarre them away.</p>
            <p>The Ocean or maine ſea, which beateth vpon the coaſt of this Iland, aboundeth with all maner of Fiſh: of which the <hi>Lucius,</hi> or <hi>Pike,</hi> as they commonly call it, they eſteeme as a deinty diſh, and therefore they oft take it out of fenny pooles and riuers, and put it into their fiſhponds and weares; where being purged and cleared from that muddy ſauour, feed with eeles and other little fiſhes, he groweth exceeding fatte and of a holeſome and pleaſing taſt. This fiſh (which is a very ſtrange thing) being brought aliue into the fiſhmarket to be ſold, they open his belly with a knife, to ſhew how fatte he is: if he be not ſold, yet of that wound he dieth not, but the ſlitte being ſewed vp, and preſently put into the pond, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſlimie tenches, it is by and by healed againe. There are no where in all the world either more daintie Oiſters, or greater ſtore.</p>
            <p>It yeeldeth alſo Gold, Siluer, Copper, and Iron, although no great quantitie of either ſort: but of Lead, and Tinne, (the Latines call that <hi>Plumbum nigrum,</hi> this <hi>Plumbum album</hi>) in their kind the beſt, is heere found in great abundaunce, and from thence is tranſported to forrein nations.</p>
            <p>The people are tall of ſtature, well fauoured and faire countenanced, for the moſt part gray eied, and as in maner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation they much reſemble the Italian, ſo in proportion and feature of body and maners they little or nothing differ from them. They ſhape their apparell much-what after the French faſhion. The women moſt faire and beautifull, do go very decently and comlily attired. They feed moſt-what on fleſh. The drinke which they vſe, and do make of malt, is indeed very good, holeſome and pleaſant; much ſought after in the Low countries, and therefore conueied thither in great abundance. At their meales both dinners and ſuppers they fare well, daintilie, liberallie, and are very merrie and pleaſant. In warre they are courageous and hardie, good archers, and cannot abide delaies and lingring; and therefore when they ioine battell and come to blowes, one part ſhall ſoone be vtterly ouerthrowne, for the conqueror ſeiſeth all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands. They build no Caſtles; yea thoſe which their aunceſtours haue built in former ages, and now are decaied, ruinous and readie to fall, they care not for the reedifying and vpholding of them. Cities they haue, and many faire townes, goodly hamlets, ſtreets, and villages. The chiefe City, mart-towne, and imperiall ſeat of their Kinges is LON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON, ſituate vpon the riuer of <hi>Thames:</hi> ioined with a faire ſtone bridge of twenty piles, very goodly arched. Vpon this bridge are houſes ſo built on ech ſide, that it ſeemeth almoſt to be a continuall ſtreet, not a bridge. This of the nature of the ſoile, temperature of the aire, manners and behauiour of the people, we haue for the moſt part gathered out of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Virgill</hi> his hiſtorie of <hi>England:</hi> for he hath very curiouſly there deſcribed this Iland. In <hi>England</hi> theſe things are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and worth the obſeruation, as this verſe ſheweth, <hi>Mons, &amp; fons, &amp; pons, eccleſia, femina, lana:</hi> Of riuers, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, ſtone bridges and wooll: Faire women, and Churches, <hi>England</hi> is full.</p>
            <p>IRELAND, is ſubiect to the crowne of <hi>England,</hi> ſo are diuers other leſſer iles, as <hi>Wight, Man, Angleſey,</hi> (the ancient ſeat of the Druydes, the Welſhmen call it, <hi>Tirmôn mam Gumry, Man</hi> the mother of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Latines, this MONA, that other MENAVIA) and thoſe which now we call the <hi>Sorlinges</hi> (the Greeks called them CASSITERIDES.) <hi>Gernſey</hi> and <hi>Gerſey</hi> with other ſmall ilands about them, although they be hard vpon the coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> yet they do belong vnto <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Humfrey Lhoyd</hi> hath ſo curiouſly deſcribed <hi>England</hi> together with the Antiquities thereof, that others before him may iuſtlie ſeeme to be accuſed of great negligence. Him did <hi>Alexander Neuill</hi> follow in his hiſtorie of the Rebellion in <hi>Norffolke,</hi> which he intituleth <hi>Norwicus. Daniel Rogers</hi> my kinſman hath written a booke of the maners, lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the ancient Brittans.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He diſcourſe of this prouince, we haue compoſed out of a certaine fragment of our ſingular good friend <hi>Humfrey Lhoyd,</hi> which not long ſince wee cauſed <hi>Birkman</hi> to imprint, for the benefit of thoſe that are ſtudents of Geography. CAMBRIA, ſaith he, the third part of <hi>Britaine,</hi> is diuided from <hi>Lhoëgria,</hi> (or <hi>England</hi> if you pleaſe ſo to call it) by the riuers <hi>Seuern</hi> and <hi>Dee,</hi> otherwiſe it is on all parts confined with the Iriſh ſea (the Geographers commonly call it <hi>Oceanus Vergiuius</hi>) it was ſo named (as they dreame) of <hi>Camber,</hi> the third ſonne of <hi>Brute.</hi> The Welſhmen call it <hi>Cymri,</hi> the Engliſh <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Latin WALLIA. This part only of this whole Brittiſh iland doth ſtil enioy the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inhabitants being indeed the true naturall Brittans: and do yet retaine the Brittiſh tongue, and cannot ſpeake one word of Engliſh, which is a language made eſpecially of the miſture of the Dutch and French tongues. <hi>Wales</hi> they do at this time diuide into three prouinces, <hi>Venedoth, Powis-land,</hi> and <hi>Dehenbarth.</hi> Vnder <hi>Venedoth</hi> the ile <hi>Angleſey,</hi> (famous long ſince, and accounted for the ancient ſeat of the <hi>Druides,</hi>) is conteined. The inhabitants in courſe of life and faſhion of apparell do follow the Engliſh: and are an idle people not willing to labour or take pains, bragging much of their gentilitie, and do giue themſelues rather to the ſeruice of Noblemen and to follow the court, than to trades and occupations. Heere hence it is that you ſhall find few Noblemen through out all <hi>England,</hi> which hath not the greateſt part of his followers &amp; ſeruants (in which thing Engliſhmen do ſurpaſſe any other nation whatſoeuer) Welſhmen borne: for being men that are fed with whitmeats or butter &amp; cheeſe, they haue nimble &amp; able bodies, fit for any maner of ſeruice. Moreouer being men of haughty minds, and in extreme penury and beggery challenging vnto themſelues to be nobly deſcended, they delight rather to go brauein apparell (like vnto the Spaniard) then to get goods or pamper their bellies, and do ſoone learne courtlike behauiour, and therefore they are of the Engliſh Nobility for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice preferred before the Engliſh. Yet of late heere they haue vſed themſelues to dwell in cities, to learn occupations, to trade as merchants, to go to plough, and to do any maner of buſineſſe good for the common-wealth as well as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh: nay in this thing they excell them, that there is no man ſo poore amongſt them, but for a while will ſet his ſonnes to ſchole to learne to write and read, and thoſe whom they find to be apt, they ſend to the Vniuerſities, &amp; cauſe them for the moſt part to giue their minds to the ſtudy of the ciuill law: Heere hence it is that the greater part of thoſe, which in this kingdome doe profeſſe the Ciuill or Canon law, are Welſhmen borne. You ſhall find alſo very few of the common and meaner ſort of people but can read and write his owne language, and after their faſhion play vpon the Welſh harpe. Now alſo they haue the Bible, and common praier booke printed in their owne tongue, a language, as we ſaid, vſed of their anceſtors and wholly different from the Engliſh. And as in old time long ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a people (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth) impatient of the leaſt wrongs that might be offered, they were alwaies together by the eares and cutting one anothers throates; ſo now for feare of law, (to which they are more obedient, then any other nation) they will wrangle and contend one with another, as long as they are worth a groate. Theſe few obſeruations we haue gleaned out of <hi>Lhoyd,</hi> to whom we ſend the Reader that deſireth more of the particulars of this country. <hi>Sylue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Gerrard,</hi> a Welſhman hath deſcribed <hi>VVales</hi> in a ſeuerall treatiſe. Read alſo the Iournall of <hi>VVales.</hi> Moreouer <hi>VVilliam</hi> of <hi>Newbery</hi> in the 5. chap. of his 2. booke hath many things of the nature of this country, &amp; maners of the people. To theſe you may adioine <hi>Polyd. Virg.</hi> &amp; thoſe things which <hi>Robert Caenalis</hi> hath written in the ſumme of his 2. booke, <hi>de re Gallica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Cymri,</hi> or (as the Engliſh call it) <hi>VVales</hi> belongeth (that we may heere by the way ſay ſomething of this) by an ancient decree, to the King of Englands eldeſt ſonne, or daughter if he faile, to the Kings heire, I meane, who is to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceed next after him: and he is called aſſoone as he is born, <hi>The Prince of VVales:</hi> and that in the ſame ſenſe, as in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> they call the Kings heire, The Prince; and in <hi>France,</hi> The Dolphin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ieffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> writeth, that in theſe parts of <hi>VVales</hi> neere the riuer of <hi>Seuern,</hi> there is a poole which the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call, <hi>Linligune.</hi> This, ſaith he, when the ſea floweth into it, enterteineth the waters like a bottomleſſe gulfe, and ſo drinketh vp the waues that it is neuer full, nor euer runneth ouer. But when the ſea ebbeth, the waters which before it had ſwallowed do ſwell like a mountaine, which then do daſh and run ouer the banks. At which time if all the people of that ſhire ſhould ſtand any thing neere the poole, with their faces toward it, ſo that the water ſhall but daſh into their clothes and apparell, they ſhall hard be able to auoid the danger, but that they ſhalbe drawne into the poole. But if ones backe ſhalbe toward it, there is no danger at all, although he ſhould ſtand vpon the very edge of the ſame. This is the ſtory, I haue nam'd the authour, let him approue the truth of the ſame. Of <hi>Mona</hi> the iland vpon the ſhore of this country thou haſt the opinion of <hi>Humfrey Lhoyd</hi> in his epiſtle which we haue adioined to the end of this booke. Of this alſo <hi>Iohn Leland</hi> in his <hi>Genethliacon</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> thus writeth: <hi>This Iland ſaith hee, being conquered by the Engliſh, changed the name, and was called</hi> Angleſey, <hi>that is; the iland of Engliſhmen.</hi> Polydore Virgill, <hi>a man of great reading, and good iudgement in many matters, is of another opinion. Hee laboureth with all his forces to proue</hi> Menauia <hi>to be</hi> Mona. <hi>If the name, which yet it retaineth: If the citie</hi> Caernaruon, <hi>which is ouer againſt it vpon the maine, do take his denomination from hence and is called</hi> Aruon <hi>for</hi> Ar-mon: <hi>If that ſame very ſhort cut ouer, of which the Roman writers do ſpeake: If the neſſe or promontorie</hi> Pen-mon, <hi>that is, as the word ſignifieth, The head of</hi> Mon: <hi>If the huge bodies of trees, and rootes couered ouer with ſand, which daily are digged out of the ſhore of</hi> Tir-mon: <hi>If the firre-trees of maruailous length, which in ſqually grounds are heere and there found within the earth in this Iland, do not ſufficiently proue that that was anciently called</hi> Mona, <hi>which now we call</hi> Angleſey, <hi>I know not what to ſay more then that I haue read this in the</hi> 14. <hi>booke of</hi> Cornelius Tacitus <hi>his Annales,</hi> Exciſi<expan>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>RELAND, which the Greekes and Latines call HIBERNIA, others IVERMA and IERNA, the Iriſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues call <hi>Eryn.</hi> From hence ſtrangers, taking it from the mouth of the Engliſh, which pronounce <hi>e,</hi> the ſecond vowell with the ſame ſound that other nations do ſound <hi>i,</hi> the third vowell, haue made, as it ſeemeth <hi>Irynlandt,</hi> compounded, as is apparent, of the Iriſh <hi>Erin,</hi> and the Saxon or Dutch <hi>Landt,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was contracted, for more commodity of ſpeach and roundneſſe of pronunciation, into <hi>Irland,</hi> from whence the Latines framed IRLANDIA. The firſt inhabitants which ſeated themſelues in this Iland came hither, as may be eaſily demonſtrated from <hi>Brittaine</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> not from <hi>Spaine,</hi> as ſome moſt abſurdly haue written. For the abridgement of <hi>Strabo</hi> doth flatly call theſe ilanders, <hi>Britaines:</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith that <hi>Irin</hi> is a part of <hi>Britaine:</hi> wherefore it was iuſtly of all old writers called, INSVLA BRITANNIA, One of the Brittiſh iles. About the yeare of CHRIST, 400. in the daies of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, at what time the Roman Empire began to decline, the Scottes, a ſecond nation entered <hi>Ireland,</hi> and planted themſelues as <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſius</hi> writeth, in the North parts, whereupon it was of them called, SCOTLAND. <hi>Sylueſter Gyraldus Cambrenſis</hi> about 400. yeares ſince deſcribed this Iland in a ſeuerall treatiſe. But becauſe that this booke as yet is not ſet forth and therefore not common and euery where to be gotten, we will out of it gather ſo much as this narrow roome may conteine, not doubting but we ſhall worthily deſerue great thankes at the readers hand for the ſame. Liſten therefore to his words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> next after <hi>England</hi> the greateſt Iland of the knowne world, hath the greater <hi>Britaine</hi> vpon his Eaſt ſide, vpon the Weſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lieth the vaſt and wide Ocean; on the North three daies ſaile from the coaſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> lieth <hi>Iſland,</hi> of all the Northren iles by far the greateſt. <hi>Britaine</hi> is almoſt twice as great as <hi>Ireland:</hi> for ſeeing that the length of both runneth the ſame way from South to North; that is, about 800. miles long, and about 200. miles broad: this from <hi>Brendam</hi> hilles to the iles <hi>Columbine</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Thorach,</hi> is about eight daies iourney, that is 400. miles long at the leaſt. <hi>Ireland</hi> conteineth in all 176. Canweds. The word <hi>Canwed</hi> is a compound word, vſed aſwell of the Welch as Iriſh, and ſignifieth a circuite of ground conteining within it 100. villages.</p>
            <p>The ſoile of <hi>Ireland</hi> is vneuen, full of hilles and dales, ſoft and ſqually, full of woods, bogges and fennes. Vpon the toppes of the higheſt and ſteepeſt hilles you ſhall oft find great ponds and bogges: yet it hath in ſome places moſt goodly plaines and champion, but in reſpect of the woods they are very little. The ground is very fatte, and fertile for Corne. The mountaines abound with ſheepe, the woods are full of Deere: and the whole ile generally is better for paſture, then for eareable ground, much better I meane, for graſſe then corne. For the kernelles of wheat are heere ſo dwined and ſmall, that they may hardly be dreſſed with any manner of fanne. That which the Spring-time doth bring forth and flouriſheth for a while in Summer, the dripping and watery Autumne will hardly ſuffer kindly to ripen or tidily to be inn'd. For this Iland is more ſubiect to bluſtering winds, outragious ſtormes of raine and floods, then any other country vnder the cope of heauen. It is very rich of honie and milke. <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Iſidore</hi> affirme that it hath no Bees: but by their leaue if they had more diligently examined the matter, they might haue on the contrarie written, that it wanteth vines, but is not altogether void of Bees. For this Iland neither now hath, nor euer had any vines: But of Bees it hath, (as any other country) great plenty: which notwithſtanding would heere, as I thinke, ſwarme in farre greater number, if it were not for the venemous and ſowre ewgh-trees which in all places of the Iland do grow in great abundance.</p>
            <p>The Iland is euery where croſſed and watered with many goodly riuers; of which the principall are theſe: <hi>Auenliſſ,</hi> runneth by <hi>Dublin: Boand</hi> (or <hi>Boine</hi>) through <hi>Methe: Banna,</hi> through <hi>Vlſter: Linne,</hi> by <hi>Connagh: Moad,</hi> by <hi>Kenelcunill, Slechey,</hi> and <hi>Samayr: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darn</hi> and <hi>Furne,</hi> by <hi>Keneleon:</hi> There are alſo very many other riuers, whereof ſome iſſuing forth of the bowels of the earth and from their cleare fountaines, other immediatly ruſhing forth of lakes and fennes wandring heere and there diuide and part the Iland into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly prouinces and ſhires. For vnder the foot of <hi>Bladina</hi> hill (now called <hi>Bliew Blemy</hi>) three famous riuers do ariſe, commonly called, <hi>The three Siſters,</hi> (for they beare the names of three ſiſters:) <hi>Berne, (Birgus,</hi> now <hi>Barrow</hi>) which runneth by <hi>Lechlin: Eoyr, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orus,</hi> they call it <hi>Nore,</hi> by <hi>Oſsire:</hi> and <hi>Swyre,</hi> by <hi>Archfine</hi> and <hi>Trebagh;</hi> neere <hi>Waterford</hi> they kindly ſalute one another, and ſo falling into one channell they quietlie toward the ſea. <hi>Slane,</hi> runneth by <hi>Wexford: Boand,</hi> by <hi>Meath: Auenmore,</hi> by <hi>Liſmore:</hi> and <hi>Simen,</hi> by <hi>Limiricke.</hi> And indeed amongſt all the riuers of <hi>Ireland, Sinnen</hi> bear'th the bell, not only for his goodly greatneſſe, long and diuers wandrings through the country, but alſo his great plenty of dainty fiſh. For it ariſeth out of a very large and goodly lake, which diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Connagh</hi> from <hi>Munſter,</hi> and ſpreadeth it ſelfe into two branches running two contrary waies: one of them tending toward the South, paſſeth by the city <hi>Kelleloe,</hi> and then encloſinge round the citie <hi>Limiricke,</hi> with a direct courſe and large ſtreame for an hundred miles and vpward, running between the two mountaines, emptieth it ſelfe into the <hi>Brendan</hi> ſea. The other not much leſſe then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, diuiding <hi>Meath</hi> and the farther parts of <hi>Vlſter</hi> from <hi>Connagh,</hi> running with a crooked courſe turning this way and that way, at laſt hideth it ſelfe in the Northren ocean: So that this riuer doth ſeparate the fourth and Weſt part of the Iland from the other three, like a midland ſtreame running from ſea to ſea. For this Iland in former ages was diuided almoſt into fiue equall parts, namely into <hi>North Mounſter, South Mounſter, Leinſter,</hi> and <hi>Connagh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This country hath diuers goodly Lakes. The ſea coaſt aboundeth plentifully with all maner of ſea-fiſh on all ſides: the Riuers and Lakes are ſtored with great variety of freſh-fiſhes: eſpecially with theſe three ſorts, Salmons, Trouts, and Eeles. The riuer <hi>Shynen</hi> ſwarmeth with Lampreyes. But there are wanting many other ſorts of good freſh-fiſh of other countries, as Pikes, Perches, Gogeons, and almoſt ſuch fiſh as come not from the ſea or ſalt waters. On the contrary the Lakes of this Iland haue three kinds of fiſh, which are no where els to be found. For they are ſomewhat longer and rounder then Trouts, very white fleſhed, paſſing ſauery and pleaſant, very like vnto the <hi>Hallibut, (Vmbra</hi> our authour calleth it) but that they are much bigger headed. There is another kind very like to herrings, aſwell for proportion and bigneſſe, as alſo for colour and taſt. There are a third ſort, in all points like trouts, but that they are not ſpotted. Yet theſe ſorts of fiſh are only ſeen in the Summer, in the Winter they neuer appeare. In <hi>Meath,</hi> neere <hi>Foner</hi> are three Lakes not farre diſtant one from another, ech of which hath certaine fiſh proper to it ſelfe, not found in any of the other two; neither do they I meane, euer come one at another, although there be moſt conuenient paſſages by reaſon of the riuer which runneth from one to another: nay if it ſhall chance that the fiſh of one lake be caried to another, either it dieth within a while after, or returneth vnto his own lake againe.</p>

            <p>From theſe naturall things let vs paſſe vnto thoſe ſtrange wonders which nature worketh in theſe out-countries of the world. In North <hi>Mounſter</hi> there is a lake wherein are two Ilands, a greater and a leſſe: the greater hath a Church, the leſſer a Chappell. Into the Greater neuer any woman, or liuing creature of the female kind might euer come, but it would die by and by. This was often proued by bitches, cattes, and other creatures of that ſex. In the leſſer no man did euer die, or could die of a naturall death. In <hi>Vlſter</hi> there is another Lake in which there is an Iland of two diuers qualities; one part of it hauing a church conſecrated to the ſeruice of Chriſtianity is very beautifull, goodly and pleaſant. The other very rough, ouer growne and vnpleaſant, is ſaid to be bequeathed to Diuels and euill ſpirits. This part hath in it nine caues or trenches, in any of which if a man do chance to ſleepe all night, he is preſently aſſaulted by the euill ſpirits, and all the night ſo greeuouſly tormented and vexed, that by the morning hee ſhall ſcarce be able to breath and will be almoſt halfe dead. This place is called of the country people, <hi>The purgatory of S. Patricke.</hi> There is alſo a ſpring or fountaine in <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> with whoſe water if any man ſhall waſh himſelfe, he will preſently become hoary or gray-headed. I my ſelfe ſaw a man who wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the one halfe of his beard with this water, and the haire became white, the other remaining blacke as it was before. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there is in <hi>Vlſter</hi> a fountaine, in which if any man waſh his haire, he ſhall neuer be horay or gray-headed. In <hi>Connagh</hi> there is a fountaine of freſh water vpon the toppe of a very high mountaine, which ebbeth twiſe in 24. houres, and floweth as oft, in this imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vnconſtant motion of the ſea. There is a fountaine in the farder and North part of <hi>Vlſter,</hi> which by reaſon of the great cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, in ſeuen yeares ſpace turneth ſticks and wood caſt into it, into ſtone. In <hi>Connagh</hi> there is a fountaine only kind and wholeſome for men: but for cattell and other ſuch kind of bruite beaſts peſtilent and dangerous. There is a fountaine in <hi>Mounſter,</hi> which if any man ſhall touch, by and by the whole country wilbe ouerflowed by ſtorms of raine.</p>
            <p>The people of this countrie do weare courſe blacke mantles or rugges (for the ſheep of this Iland are blacke) and they put them on as rudely and vnhandſomely. They vſe alſo little hoods which hang down to their ſhoulders. In riding they vſe no ſaddles, boots, nor ſpurres: but with a rod ſharpe and tapered at one end, they pricke forward their horſes, and make them runne. Their bridles are ſuch as do ſerue both for bitte and reigne, ſo made as their horſes only vſed to graſſe, are neuer hindred from eating. They go into the field to warre, naked and altogether vnarmed. They vſe three kind of weapons, long ſpeares, darts, and battell-axes. The people is wild and very vnciuill: they delight in nothing more then to liue idly, and libertie they preferre before great riches. I only obſerued the people to delight much in muſicall inſtruments and in that to deſerue ſome commendation. Theſe briefly we haue gleaned heere and there out of the hiſtorie of <hi>Gyraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> diligently retaining the tenor of his owne phraſe: which we haue thought good to tranſlate word for word as they are deliuered by our Authour, that ſuccedent ages might ſee, either the credulous ſimplicity of former times, or how time doth alter countries, people and maners of men. And becauſe we haue ſpoken before of <hi>S. Patricks</hi> purgatory, it ſhall not be amiſſe to adde to thoſe former this diſcourſe of it, taken out of the twelfth booke of <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> his hiſtorie of Things worth the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring. When as S. <hi>Patricke,</hi> ſaith he, conuerted this nation to Chriſtianity, and they made a doubt and beleeued not that men ſhould be puniſhed for their ſinnes in the world to come, hee by earneſt praier obtained this place at the hand of God: the maner of the place is thus: There is a deepe pit or trench, encloſed round with a wall; there are alſo certaine Regular Canons: No man is ſo great a ſinner, to whom they enioine any greater penance, then to abide all one whole night in that purgatorie. If any man be deſirous to enter in, firſt, making his confeſſion, they adminiſter the ſacrament vnto him, they anoint him, perfume him and inſtruct him, thus: Thou ſhalt ſee this night ſay they, the aſſaults of the Deuill, and the horrible paines of hell, but they ſhall not hurt thee, if thou haue but the name of Ieſus alwaies in thy mouth: But if thou ſhalt yeeld to the flattering enticements, or terrible threatnings of the Deuill, and ſo ſhalt ceaſe to call vpon the name of Ieſus, thou art ſurely but a dead man. Then in the euening putting him into the pit, they ſhut vp the dore, and comming againe in the morning, if they preſentlie find him not, they looke no farther for him. Many haue died there, and many haue gone home againe, whoſe viſions haue been written of the foreſaied friers, and are ſhewed to ſuch as are deſirous to ſee them.</p>

            <p>To theſe the Reader may adioine ſuch things as <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington, Polydore Virgill, William Newbery, Iohn Maior,</hi> and others haue written of this in their ſeuerall hiſtories. <hi>Daniel Rogers</hi> hath ſet forth a deſcription of this Iland in verſe dedicated to <hi>Thomas Phediger.</hi> And M. <hi>William Camden</hi> in proſe hath moſt exactly deſcribed the ſame in his <hi>Britannia.</hi> But <hi>Richard Stanihurſt,</hi> a worthy gentleman this countrie man borne, hath this other day put forth a ſeueral treatiſe of the hiſtory and ſtate of this iland. <hi>Baptiſta Boazio</hi> hath deſcribed it in a mappe apart by it ſelfe, dedicated to the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and my good friend M. <hi>Speed,</hi> with no leſſe care and diligence hath done the ſame in his <hi>Imperium Brittannicum,</hi> or Empire of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> lately ſet forth and dedicated to his Highneſſe.</p>

            <p>The iſlands belonging vnto <hi>Spaine,</hi> wherof ancient writers haue made mention, at the Celtick promontory, or Cape Finiſter, are the <hi>Caſsiterides,</hi> which at this preſent are not to be found in the ocean. Alſo <hi>Inſulae Deorum,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Cicae,</hi> and of late times <hi>Iſlas de Bayona: Londobris</hi> named alſo <hi>Erythia,</hi> and now the <hi>Burlings: Gades</hi> in olde time dedicated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> now commonly called <hi>Cales.</hi> All theſe are in the Ocean. In the Mediterran ſea you haue <hi>Ophiuſa</hi> now called <hi>Formentera.</hi> As likewiſe the two <hi>Gymneſiae,</hi> or <hi>Baleares,</hi> at this preſent called by diſtinct names, the one <hi>Maiorca,</hi> and the other <hi>Minorca.</hi> The coaſt of <hi>Minorca</hi> is beſet round about with huge mountaines: but at the entrance of the hauen the roots of theſe mountaines are leuelled into a plaine, till they meet, at ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a diſtance, on the other ſide of the ſhore, that no ſhips can enter the harbor, but with a gentle gale of wind. The hauen is named <hi>Mahon,</hi> being a moſt beautifull, and commodious place; for it ſtretcheth almoſt foure miles in length, with many inlets, all which ſerue for the harboring of ſhips. From hence ariſeth a perpetuall ridge of mountaines, on which the inhabitants cut downe great plenty of wood. At the vtmoſt part therof on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-tops is built a city. Contrariwiſe the greater Iſland hath a plaine ſhore, and moſt high and barren moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in the middeſt. A city there is of one and the ſelfe name with the Iſland, very large and fairly built. They vſe the lawes of the Caſtilians, and do much reſemble them both in language and maners. This deſcription of the iſles <hi>Maiorca</hi> &amp; <hi>Minorca</hi> we haue borrowed out of <hi>N. Villagagnon</hi> his diſcourſe of the expedition to <hi>Alger.</hi> Who deſires to know more of theſe iſles, and of the inhabitants diſpoſition, may reade <hi>Bernardin Gomez</hi> his ſixt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth books of the life of <hi>Iames T.</hi> King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> That <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> poſſeſſeth the greateſt Empire in the world, ſince the worlds beginning, we haue proued in our Theatre printed in high Dutch.</p>

            <head>The Kingdome of PORTVGALE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ORTVGALE</hi> is vnproperly called <hi>Luſitania;</hi> for neither is all <hi>Portugale</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in <hi>Luſitania,</hi> nor all <hi>Luſitania</hi> in <hi>Portugale:</hi> yet can it not be denied, that the better part of <hi>Luſitania</hi> is ſubiect to the King of <hi>Portugale. Portugale</hi> is diuided into three regions, <hi>Tranſtagana,</hi> or that which lies beyond or South of <hi>Tagus,</hi> the riuer of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> as far as <hi>Guadiana; Ciſtagana</hi> ſituate on this ſide or North of <hi>Tagus,</hi> as far as the riuer <hi>Douro;</hi> and <hi>Interamnis. Tranſtagana</hi> border vpon that part of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> which from the riuer <hi>Guadiana</hi> extendeth to the limits of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilia Nuoua. Interamnis</hi> I call that which lies between the riuers <hi>Douro</hi> and <hi>Minho,</hi> a region no leſſe pleaſant than fruitfull. This <hi>Interamnis</hi> or Riuer bounded prouince, is wholly out of the limits of <hi>Luſitania;</hi> vnleſſe reiecting the former deſcription, we will rather incline to <hi>Strabo,</hi> who ſaith that the greateſt part of <hi>Luſitania</hi> is inhabited by the <hi>Callaici.</hi> The length of this region is twelue leagues, and the bredth, where it is largeſt, is twelue leagues alſo; being in other places but ſix or foure leagues ouer. And in this ſo ſmall a portion of ground, beſides the Metropolitan church of <hi>Braga,</hi> the Cathedrall of <hi>Porto,</hi> and other fiue Collegiate churches, there are aboue <hi>130.</hi> monaſteries, the greater part whereof are endowed with moſt ample reuenues: and alſo to the number of <hi>1460.</hi> Pariſh churches, as one writeth. Certaine it is, that within the peculiar Dioceſſe of <hi>Braga</hi> there are accounted <hi>800.</hi> Whereby you may eaſily coniecture both the fruitfulneſſe of the ſoile, and the ancient deuotion of the inhabitants. But of the pleaſantneſſe what need we ſpeake, whenas within this one prouince are found aboue fiue and twenty thouſand ſpringing fountaines; bridges moſt ſumptuouſly built of ſquare ſtone almoſt two hundred; and hauens for ſhipping to the number of ſix? Theſe things therefore I thought not vnfit to be remembred, becauſe the goodneſſe and woorth of this Prouince is in a maner vnknowen. To the East hereof adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the prouince called <hi>Tranſmontana,</hi> that is to ſay, on the other ſide of the mountaines; it aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with excellent Wheat, and ſtrong Wine, and containes within it the city <hi>Bragança,</hi> which is the head of a moſt large Dukedome. Thus much out of <hi>Vaſeus. Peter de Medina</hi> reckoneth and nameth in this Kingdome of <hi>Portugale</hi> ſixty ſeuen cities or walled townes.</p>
            <p>To the Kingdome of <hi>Portugale</hi> at this preſent belongeth the Kingdome of <hi>Algarue,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but the South part of the whole Kingdome towards the ſea. For the King entitles himſelfe <hi>King of Portugale, of Algarue, of Guinie, of Aethiopia, Perſia and India.</hi> This Kingdom firſt began about the yeere <hi>1100.</hi> For vntill then, as alſo in ancient times, it went altogether vnder the name of <hi>Spaine. Marinaeus</hi> thus writeth of it: One <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Loraigne,</hi> a man of most vndoubted valour, comming out of <hi>France</hi> atchieued great exploits againſt the <hi>Moores.</hi> In regard wherof <hi>Alonſo</hi> the ſixt, King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> gaue him in marriage his baſe daughter called <hi>Tireſia;</hi> and aſsigned for her dowry part of <hi>Gallicia</hi> contained in the kingdome of <hi>Portugale.</hi> Of this marriage afterwards was born <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Portugale,</hi> he that recouered <hi>Lisbon</hi> from the <hi>Moores.</hi> Who hauing vanquiſhed fiue of their Kings in one battell, left vnto poſterity, as a monument of this exploit, his armes conſiſting of fiue ſcutchions. <hi>Oliuer à Marca</hi> in his Chronicle publiſhed in French, more particularly blazeth the armes of this kingdome. At firſt he ſaith, it was a plaine ſiluer ſcutchion without any portra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; afterwards in regard of the fiue vanquiſhed kings there were fiue ſcutchions impoſed; and in euery of the fiue ſcutchions fiue ſiluer circles, in remembrance of the fiue wounds of our Sauior <hi>CHRIST,</hi> which in time of the battell miraculouſly appeared vnto <hi>Alphonſo</hi> in the skies; or (as others report) for that being wounded with fiue mortall wounds, by the prouidence of Almighty God he eſcaped death.</p>
            <p>Reade alſo <hi>Ierome Oſorius, Marinaeus Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian Munſter.</hi> Of the originall of this Kingdome reade the firſt chapter of <hi>Iohn Barros</hi> his Decades of <hi>Aſia. Athenaeus</hi> in his eighth booke and firſt chapter writeth ſomewhat of the fruitfulneſſe of this Region, and the excellent tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the aire. <hi>Lisbon</hi> the chiefe city of the Kingdome, <hi>Damianus a Goes</hi> deſcribeth in a peculiar Treatiſe. Concerning the antiquities of <hi>Portugale</hi> there is a booke written by <hi>Andrew Reſende.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Portugales Dominions at this preſent are very large; for they extend euen from the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> along all the Sea Prouinces, and the Iſlands adiacent, as farre as <hi>China,</hi> and the Iſles called <hi>Lequios.</hi>

This territory containeth here &amp; there almoſt 200. principall townes, beſides a great number of villages; ſo that there are now more townes vnder the iuriſdiction of this one dioceſſe or conuent, than there were of old in all foure together: for (as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth) they preſcribed lawes but only to 175. townes.

            <p>Next vnto <hi>Siuill</hi> in authority and greatneſſe <hi>Caeſariana,</hi> alias <hi>Xeres de la frontiera,</hi> and <hi>Iulia firmitas</hi> now called <hi>Astigi,</hi> which in old times were colonies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> do excell all other townes &amp; cities. <hi>Carmona</hi> and <hi>Vtrera</hi> may well be termed the two granaries and ſtorehouſes of <hi>Siuill.</hi> Next followes <hi>Marchena,</hi> called out of ancient ſtonie monuments, I know not how truly, <hi>Martia Colonia;</hi> and <hi>Arçobriga,</hi> being the lord-ſhip townes of the moſt illuſtrious ducal familie of the <hi>Ponces.</hi> To theſe you may adde <hi>Vrſao,</hi> called of old <hi>Genua Vrbanorum,</hi> and at this preſent <hi>Oſuna,</hi> the moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and rich dukedome of the <hi>Girones,</hi> ennobled with an Vniuerſitie. For oile, corne, and wine <hi>Conſtantina, Caçalla,</hi> and <hi>Maronio</hi> do principally excell: <hi>Nebriſa</hi> likewiſe ſituate at the mouth of <hi>Baetis,</hi> the moſt happie natiue ſoile of <hi>Aelius Antonius,</hi> the reſtorer and author of the Latin tongue in <hi>Spaine,</hi> is famous for antiquity, and inferiour to none in plenty of Corne. Alſo in the very bay whereinto <hi>Baetis</hi> diſchargeth his ſtreames, vpon the headland called of old <hi>Luciferi Promontorium,</hi> ſtands the towne which we now call <hi>Solucar</hi> or <hi>Sant lucar,</hi> the rich mart-towne of the <hi>Gothiſh Dukes,</hi> and very commodious for the weſt-Indan fleets. Other principall townes of this Dioceſſe for breuities ſake I omit.</p>
            <p>The ſoile in all this tract is moſt miraculouſly plentifull of wheat, wine, and oile, and of all kinde of graine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it ſupplieth remote and forrein countreies: and how deſeruedly might <hi>Plinie</hi> haue preferred this part before <hi>Italie,</hi> had not he, an Italian, caried a greater affection to his owne countrey? yet <hi>Spaine</hi> by him: whereſoeuer it borders vpon the ſea, is commended: which praiſe of his we vnderſtand eſpecially of that part of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> which pertaines to the Dioceſſe of <hi>Siuill,</hi> becauſe it lies open to the maine Ocean, and to the gentle blaſts of the weſt. The skie here is moſt fauourable, ſmiling alwaies with a temperate and moſt amiable aſpect: the people borne to piety and good arts, excelling in ſharpneſſe of wit, and ſurpaſſing others in a bold kinde of courage and towardlineſſe of minde (which is in a manner peculiar, and hereditary to this nation) will in no caſe ſuffer themſelues either in offices of curteſie, or in exploit of warre, to be excelled by any nation.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Siuill,</hi> next that of <hi>Toledo,</hi> is the higheſt prelacy in all <hi>Spaine;</hi> whilome it had eleuen ſuffragan Biſhops, as appeareth out of the ſubſcriptions of councells: namely, the Biſhop of <hi>Corduba,</hi> who now is vnder the Iuriſdiction of <hi>Toledo:</hi> The B. of <hi>Iliberis,</hi> who after the expulſion of the <hi>Moores,</hi> remoued to the Metropolitan ſea of <hi>Granada:</hi> The B. of <hi>Ilipa</hi> or <hi>Elepla,</hi> of late called <hi>Pennaflor,</hi> which towne is now deſtitute of a B. ſea, and ſubſcribes to the authority of the church of <hi>Siuill.</hi> The Biſhopricke of <hi>Tuccitan,</hi> now called <hi>Martos,</hi> and in old time <hi>Auguſta Gemella Colonia,</hi> at this preſent deſtitute of a B. and vnder the Iuriſdiction of <hi>Gienna.</hi> The Biſhopricke of <hi>Malaga,</hi> which now is ſuffragan to <hi>Siuill.</hi> The Biſhopricke of <hi>Aegabria,</hi> now called <hi>Cabra:</hi> it hath no prelate, but belongeth to the church of <hi>Corduba.</hi> The biſhopricke of <hi>Aſindia</hi> or <hi>Aſidonia,</hi> now called <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> ſubiect to the B. of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> the epiſcopall ſea being remoued from <hi>Gadiſea,</hi> others call it <hi>Aſidonia;</hi> it is now ſaid to ſtand not farre from that place, where <hi>Xeres</hi> is ſituate; vnleſſe you will ſay, that in the ſame tract it retained one and the ſelfe-ſame name. It had alſo the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of <hi>Oſſonoba</hi> nere <hi>Pharo</hi> a towne in <hi>Algarue,</hi> the Moores named it <hi>Eruba,</hi> afterwards it was incorporated into the church of <hi>Siluis,</hi> which before being a member of <hi>Siuill,</hi> was by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third made Suffragan to <hi>Euora,</hi> which himſelfe had aduanced to a Metropolitan ſea. The biſhopricke of <hi>Abdera,</hi> which was tranſlated to the ſea of <hi>Almeria,</hi> and is now Suffragan to <hi>Granada.</hi> The biſhopricke of <hi>Aſtigi,</hi> which now is ingraffed into the church of <hi>Siuill.</hi> The bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricke of <hi>Italica,</hi> ſeated in a moſt noble colonie of the Romans not only citizens, but alſo Emperors &amp; Generals, which ſtanding ſix miles from <hi>Siuill,</hi> on the other ſide <hi>Baetis,</hi> was in ancient times, when <hi>S. Gerontius</hi> the martyr was bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, a place highly reuerenced. Out of this towne ſprang <hi>Traianus, Hadrian,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> three great and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Emperors. It is commonly called Old <hi>Siuill,</hi> the vaſt ruines thereof being now ſcarſe extant, a wofull ſpectacle of the mutability of humane things, by ſo much the more to be lamented, in that the forlorne fragments of that moſt beautifull and large <hi>Amphitheatrum,</hi> which now lie ſcattered and diſiointed, renew a more ſad memory of the ancient greatneſſe and magnificence.</p>
            <p>At this time the Archbiſhop of <hi>Siuill</hi> hath for ſuffragans the biſhops of <hi>Malaga,</hi> of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and of the <hi>Canary-iſles.</hi> The maieſty, dignity &amp; wealth of this church we cannot in few words decypher. Sufficeth that we do gather out of their own audits &amp; accounts, that the archbiſhops yerely reuenues amount to aboue 100000. duckets. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall of the church vnder him haue cleerely more than 30000: the whole ſociety of the church is allowed 120000. which are diuided among 40. Canons, 11. priuileged prieſts, 20. fellow-portionaries or penſioners, and ſo many halfe-penſioners; yet ſo, as the Canons and priuileged prieſts haue ſuch daily allowance, as by the yeere comes to 2000. duckats a man, the penſioners haue leſſe than ſo much by a fourth part, and the halfe-penſioners are allowed only a third part. Next vnto the Archbiſhop the greateſt authority remaines in the Deane, whoſe dignity is eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med worth 5000. duckats a yeere. Beſides, here are in this church 20. maſſe-prieſts, which from their number we call <hi>Vicenarios;</hi> who for their nightly and daily orizons, are allowed euery day amongſt them all 200. duckats and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue: alſo there are 200. other prieſts, who out of their priuate chapels do raiſe ſtipends ſufficient for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Rich benefices in this dioceſſe there are to the number of 600, many whereof are valued at 1000. ſome at 2000. duckats by the yeere: and of leſſer cures, which are called chapels or chanteries, almoſt 2000. Here are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many cloiſters of monks and nunnes, wherein their religion and the ſtudy of their diuinity flouriſheth, moſt of them in yeerely reuenues being able to diſpend 6000. duckats. There ſtands a monaſtery of Carthuſians moſt ſumptuouſly built vpon the banke of <hi>Baetis</hi> within view of <hi>Siuill,</hi> which hath 25000. duckats by the yeere. Long it were to recken vp all their hoſpitals, whenas within <hi>Siuill</hi> only there are aboue 120. very richly indowed, many with 8000. and ſome with 15000. duckats of yerely income. Thus much of this region or dioceſſe, out of the relation of <hi>Don Franciſco Pacheco.</hi> Concerning <hi>Siuill</hi> and the territory thereto adiacent you may reade at large in the Iournall of <hi>Nauagierus.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is ſituate vpon the Mediterran ſea, and is refreſhed with the ſtreames of <hi>Turia,</hi> a riuer ſo called by <hi>Saluſt, Priſcian,</hi> and <hi>Vibius:</hi> by <hi>Pomponius Mela, Durias,</hi> and by <hi>Plinie, Turium.</hi> Now they call it <hi>Guetalabiar,</hi> which is an Arabicke name impoſed by the Moores, and in Engliſh is as much to ſay, as pure and cleare water. It is a riuer not very deepe; but in regard of the euerflouriſhing banks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decked with roſes and ſundry kinds of flowers, moſt exceeding pleaſant. It is on both ſides from the very fountaine to the outlet, naturally clad with beautifull and ſhadie woods: euery where you may behold the Withy, the Plane, the Pine-tree, and other trees, neuer diſrobed of their leaues: ſo that <hi>Claudian</hi> wrote moſt truly of it; <hi>Faire</hi> Duria, <hi>with flowers and roſie banks adorn'd.</hi> There is alſo the riuer <hi>Sucro,</hi> which by a new name they call <hi>Xucar.</hi> Two hilles here are among the rest, one called <hi>Mariola,</hi> and the other <hi>Pennagoloſa,</hi> that is, The rocke of dainties; wherunto from other places reſort great ſtore of Herbaliſts &amp; Phyſicians: for vpon theſe hilles grow great abundance of very rare plants and herbs. They haue alſo a ſiluer-mine at a place called <hi>Buriol,</hi> in the way from <hi>Valentia</hi> to <hi>Tortoſa.</hi> In a place likewiſe named <hi>Aioder</hi> are found certaine ſtones interlaced with golden veines. At Cape <hi>Fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat</hi> there are yron-mines, and ſo are there by <hi>Iabea.</hi> About <hi>Segorbia,</hi> there is yet mention of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, from whence Marble was wont to be conueyed to <hi>Rome.</hi> In <hi>Picacent</hi> they dig Alabaſter, and all the countrey ouer Allume, Oker, Lime, and Plaiſter in great abundance. But the greatest riches of this countrey conſiſteth in earthen veſſels, which they call Porcellan: which may perhaps be the ſame that ancient Writers call <hi>Vaſa Murrhina.</hi> Theſe are made in diuers places of this kingdome ſo curiouſly, and with ſuch arte, as the beſt Porcellans in <hi>Italie,</hi> (whereof in all countreys ſuch reckening is made) can hardly be preferred before them. Who deſires to know more of the excellency of this region, and how fertile it is of all things, eſpecially of Sugar, Wine and Oile; let him reade the <hi>9. 12.</hi> and <hi>13.</hi> books written by <hi>Bernardine Gomez,</hi> concerning the life of <hi>Iames</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>Aragon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the cities of this kingdome, <hi>Valentia</hi> is the principall, and the ſea of a biſhop; which biſhop (as <hi>Marinaeus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Damianus a Goes</hi> do report) may diſpend <hi>13000.</hi> duckats by the yeere.

Plinie</hi> cals it a colonie of the Romans. He ſaith, it is three miles diſtant from the ſea.

By the inhabitants alſo it was properly called <hi>Erythia,</hi> and <hi>Cotinuſa,</hi> by the Carthaginians <hi>Gadir,</hi> and the Romans named it <hi>Tarteſſon,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth. At this preſent there is but one only iſle (and that verie much diminiſhed by the oceans violent waues) which the Spaniards call <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and corruptly <hi>Caliz,</hi> and our countrymen (I know not vpon what ground) <hi>Calis-Malis.</hi> In the leſſer of the two foreſaid iſles ſtood the towne of <hi>Gades;</hi> and in the greater, <hi>Iulia Gaditana Auguſta;</hi> which before, as appeareth out of <hi>Strabo,</hi> was called <hi>Neapolis.</hi> Now they call both towne and iſland <hi>Cadiz.</hi> It is the ſeat of a Biſhop, who alſo is intitled Biſhop of <hi>Alger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Iſle was firſt diſcouered and inhabited by certaine Phoenicians of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> as is euident out of moſt ancient records. Vpon this iſle ſome are of opinion, that the Geryones afterward planted themſelues, whoſe droues the Aegyptian or Tyrian <hi>Hercules</hi> forcibly draue away. At one corner of the iſle ſtood the temple of this <hi>Hercules,</hi> famous both for builders, ſuperſtition, riches and antiquity. Why it ſhould be holy (ſaith <hi>Mela</hi>) his bones there buried are a ſufficient cauſe. Vpon the other corner <hi>Strabo</hi> affirmes the temple of <hi>Saturne</hi> to haue been ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. In the ſaid temple of <hi>Hercules, Caeſar</hi> found the image of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> in his life reporteth. A fountaine there was very holſome to drinke, which with a ſtrange kind of contrariety diminiſhed at the floud, and increaſed at the ebbe of the ſea. In this temple (as the ſame author affirmeth) were certaine brazen pillars of eight cubits, wheron were ingrauen the coſts beſtowed in building of the ſame. Here alſo the ſame author out of <hi>Artemidorus</hi> acknowledgeth a temple dedicated to <hi>Iuno. Dionyſius</hi> deſcribes therein the temple of Age and of Death, and tels of certaine altars conſecrated to the Yere, to the Moneth, to Arte, and to Pouerty. <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars are here extant (ſaith <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>) and here growes a kind of tree like a palme, with the gum whereof the glaſſe of <hi>Epyrus</hi> being mingled, is turned into a precious ſtone.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of old were famous for their skill in nauigation, and from this their ancient trauerſing of the ſeas, they do not as yet dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. But their principall gaine conſiſteth in making of Salt, and in catching of Tunies: for which they haue euery yeere an ordinary fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Some ancient records of this country do not vndeſeruedly name it The wall and fortreſſe of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon.</hi> It is a mountainous place, euery where ſo abounding with yron and ſteele, that for quantity and goodneſſe of this mettall it is excelled by no other region in the world. Wherefore from hence to their great commodity, all the neighbour-countries are abundantly ſupplied with all kind of iron-tooles and inſtruments.

Such as dwell vpon the coaſts, ſpending the greateſt part of their time at ſea, reape vnto themſelues great profit, by taking Newfoundland fiſh called <hi>Baccalaos,</hi> and Whales; of whoſe fat they make great quantitie of Traine-oile.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Table repreſenteth that part of <hi>Gallia Lugdunenſis</hi> which ſtretcheth toward the Weſterne Ocean. The ancients named it <hi>Armorica.</hi> Heere ſtandeth <hi>Neuſtria,</hi> corruptly ſo called of late yeeres for <hi>Veſtria</hi> or rather <hi>Weſtria,</hi> (according to ſome, <hi>Weſtraſia</hi>) as much to ſay, as a Weſterne region. The occaſion of this errour both in pronunciation and writing, was for that the French wanting a double V, doe alwayes in ſtead thereof write a ſingle V: and becauſe u in this ſmall forme differs not much from n, hereupon it is likely that <hi>Weſtria</hi> was prodigiouſly changed into <hi>Neuſtria.</hi> In which <hi>Neuſtria</hi> at this preſent are ſituate the regions of <hi>Bretaigne</hi> and <hi>Normandie,</hi> which in this Table we preſent vnto your view. NORMANDIA ſo called of the Northerne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ouer-ranne it (for <hi>Nord</hi> in Dutch ſignifieth North, and <hi>mannen</hi> men) which Northerne people were Danes and Noruegians: who hauing by force ſubdued this region, planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues here in the time of <hi>Lotharius</hi> the Emperour. Concerning the ſituation and nature of this place, theſe are the words of <hi>Gaguinus</hi> in his ſeuenth booke: <hi>Normandie</hi> is adorned and fortified with one Metropolitan, ſix cities, and ninetie foure ſtrong townes and caſtles: moſt of their villages alſo being built citie-like: thorow which Prouince a ſpeedie traueller ſhall hardlie paſſe in ſix dayes: it aboundeth with fiſh, cattell, and plentie of corne; being in all places ſo fraught with peares and apples, that the people make all their drinke of the ſame; and yet ſend great quantitie to other countreys. They exerciſe clothing, and are notable quaffers of cyder. They are naturally a wilie people; ſubiect to no forren lawes; liuing after their owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions and cuſtomes, which they moſt obſtinately maintaine: cunning they are in ſleights and ſutes of law; whereupon ſtrangers are loth to haue any dealings with them; being otherwiſe well addicted to learning and religion. Moreouer, they are very apt and valiant in the warres, many of whoſe worthy acts againſt ſtrangers are recorded. Thus farre <hi>Gaguinus.</hi> Of the qualitie of this region you may more largely informe your ſelfe out of <hi>Henry Altiſsiodorenſis</hi> his fifth booke of the life of <hi>S. German.</hi> It aboundeth, as <hi>Caenalis</hi> makes report, with all things neceſſary for mans life, wine only excepted, which the ſoile doth not yeeld. The chiefe city is <hi>Rouen</hi> (in Engliſh commonly called <hi>Roan</hi>) which hath a moſt learned Senate, or Court of Parliament, that execute iuſtice, and decide the controuerſies of the whole Prouince. Heere are alſo great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, by meanes of whoſe trafficke the citie is knowen farre and neere. In this citie there is a church dedicated to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> beautified with a moſt lofty ſteeple, wherin hangs the greateſt bell in all <hi>France,</hi> weighing forty thouſand pounds, as theſe French verſes grauen thereupon do teſtifie.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Ie ſuis nominée <hi>George</hi> d' Amboiſe,</l>
               <l>Qui plus que trente ſix mil poiſe:</l>
               <l>Et ſi qui bien me poyſera</l>
               <l>Quarante mil y trouuera.</l>
            </q>

                  <hi>George</hi> de Amboiſe my name rightly ſounds,</l>

               <l>Whoſo poiſeth me well</l>
               <l>Fortie thouſand may tell.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This <hi>George,</hi> after whoſe name the bell is called, was Archbiſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> about the yeere 1500. who conſidering that in his Dioceſſe (ſuch was the ſcarſitie of oile, as it would hardly be ſufficient for the time of Lent) granted to his Dioceſſans in ſtead thereof the vſe of butter, conditionally that they ſhould pay ſix halfepence Tournois a piece: with which ſumme of money he cauſed the ſaid ſteeple to be built; which thereupon is yet called <hi>Latour de beur;</hi> that is, The ſteeple of butter. The antiquities, and other memorable matters of this city, <hi>F. Noel Taillipied</hi> hath deſcribed in French in a peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. Thus much of <hi>Normandie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BRETAIGNE bordering vpon the coaſt of <hi>Normandie,</hi> is the vtmoſt prouince of <hi>France</hi> toward the Ocean. Some thinke that this was of old called <hi>Aremorica.</hi> Sure I am that <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſcribeth cities which he calleth <hi>Aremericas</hi> vpon this coaſt. But <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Sidonius</hi> do name the inhabitants <hi>Britannos,</hi> placing them vpon the riuer of <hi>Loire.</hi> The Middle-age writers call them <hi>Brittones,</hi> which name they yet retaine. <hi>Plinie</hi> moſt aptly calles this region, The godlieſt Peninſula of <hi>Gallia Lugdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis.</hi> In a fragment of the Frankes hiſtory I reade that it was once called <hi>The horne of France;</hi> from the ſhape thereof, as I ſuppoſe. <hi>Robert Caenalis</hi> is of opinion, that the Brittons being named <hi>Hermiones,</hi> tooke occaſion by way of alluſion vnto this name, to make choiſe of thoſe armes which they now beare, commonly called <hi>Ermines,</hi> with weaſels tailes, and the natiue colour of blacke in a field argent &amp;c. This region he ſaith is ſomewhat drie, and not very fruitfull; more apt to beare millet than wheat. Their fields (ſaith he) they call lands. It ſeemeth more properly to be named <hi>Eremorica</hi> than <hi>Aremorica.</hi> For they make larger leagues betweene towne and towne, namely of three miles; which is no ſlight argument of a barren ſoile. Hereof the coniecture ſeemes not improbable, that it was called <hi>Brutannia,</hi> of nouriſhing or feeding brute beaſts.

Poictou</hi> is now diuided into the Lower and the Vpper: The Lower <hi>Poictou</hi> we call that which ends Weſtward vpon the ſea of <hi>Aquitaigne:</hi> and the Vpper, which lieth Eaſtward towards <hi>Tourain</hi> and <hi>Berry:</hi> South it confines vpon <hi>Xantoigne, Angoleſme,</hi> and <hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin:</hi> and North vpon <hi>Brettaigne</hi> and <hi>Aniou.</hi> It is a countrey moſt fertile of corne and cattell; rich in wheat and wine; and abounding with fiſh. Wild-fowle and beaſts heere are great plenty, and for that cauſe much hunting and hauking.</p>
            <p>In this region are conteined 1200.

The head of all theſe is <hi>Poictiers,</hi> which next vnto <hi>Paris</hi> is the principall citie in all <hi>France,</hi> and is for the moſt part enuironed by the riuer <hi>Clain.</hi> The antiquity of this towne ſufficiently appeareth out of the Theater (commonly called <hi>Arenas</hi>) as likewiſe out of <hi>Gallienus</hi> his Palace, and the Arches of Water-conducts as yet extant, which the inhabitants call <hi>Arceaux de Parignè:</hi> all which are Monuments of the Romans gouernment in this place. Howbeit before their comming, this citie was ſeated vpon another plot of ground, as may be gathered out of the writings of <hi>Ammonius</hi> and <hi>Ado.</hi> For they make mention of a place called Olde <hi>Poictiers,</hi> whereat (they ſay) was the diuiſion of the kingdome betweene <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> and <hi>Pipin</hi> Kings of the Frankes.

Lazarus</hi> ſuburbs. This riuer alſo bends his courſe to the towne of <hi>S. Anne,</hi> and to the ſuburbe called <hi>Rich:</hi> for Eaſt, Weſt, and South it toucheth the riuer <hi>Indre;</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> all the region to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Maine.</hi> To the Dukedome and gouernment of <hi>Tourain</hi> are ſubiect theſe cities, <hi>Chinon, Lodun, Touars, Langeſtz, Amboiſe, Loches, Chaſtillon</hi> vpon <hi>Indre, Montrichard,</hi> beſides other places and fortreſſes of Barons. But the cities which I haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med are of beſt note, and as it were the principall members of the whole Dukedome. Concerning euery of which I will ſpeake more largely, hauing ſaid ſomwhat of the Metropolitan: whereunto belong the third part of Biſhop-townes, which in times paſt were vnder the ancient iuriſdiction of <hi>Lugdune.</hi> For vnder the third receiued diuiſion of Dioceſſes apperteining to the Primacie of <hi>Lugdune</hi> or <hi>Lions,</hi> are comprehended <hi>Tours, La Mans, Angiers, Rhenes, Nants, Cornevaile, Vannes, S. Poll de Leon, Tregoir, Dol, S. Malo, S. Brieu.</hi> The Turones therefore of ſuch antiquitie, and their city the head of ſo many Nations, <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the firſt rancke of the people of <hi>France:</hi> and ſo likewiſe do other ancient Writers. <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemey</hi> placeth them vpon the riuer <hi>Ligeris:</hi> and <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> in <hi>Secundâ Lugdunenſi.</hi> But in <hi>Caeſar</hi> they are oftener mentioned, and that very plainly, eſpecially at the end of his eleuenth booke <hi>De bello Gallico. This done</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and all</hi> France <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at quiet, ſo great an opinion of this war ſurprized the Barbarians, that euen thoſe nations which inhabited beyond</hi> Rhene, <hi>ſent ambaſſadours vnto</hi> Caeſar, <hi>promiſing to giue him pledges, and to obey his commandements. He therefore hauing ended his warres, and put his legions in gariſon among the Carnutes, Andes, and Turones, which were cities neere vnto theſe places, departed for</hi> Italie. Hence you may gather, that they were not enemies to the Romans, but rather <hi>Caeſars</hi> followers. <hi>Gregory Turonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> often calles them <hi>Senatores Romanos,</hi> for they enioyed the libertie of Free-denizens, which was granted to none but ſuch as were the Romans deere friends, and linked vnto them in moſt firme league. The Touranois are held to be one of the richeſt people in all <hi>France,</hi> both for the fruitfulneſſe of their fields (which they deſeruedly call <hi>The Kings garden</hi>) and alſo for their excellent maner of gouernment, and the induſtry of their Citizens, who are eſpecially addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to traffique, for which purpoſe their nauigable riuer ſtands them in great ſtead. They haue alſo attempted of late to make ſilke, than which <hi>Italie</hi> affoords no better. At the Eaſt part of <hi>Tourain,</hi> vpon the riuer <hi>Loire,</hi> ſtands <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> built in a moſt excellent and choiſe ſeat, and a delicate pure aire: ſo that this place eſpecially, the French Kings haue choſen to retire and ſolace themſelues in. The city of <hi>Montrichard</hi> ſituate on a plaine, is on the one ſide fortified with Rocks and Woods, and hem'd in on the other ſide with Medowes and delightſome Fields. Without the city are houſes vnder ground with Gardens and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyards on the tops of them. <hi>Loches</hi> vpon the riuer of <hi>Indre,</hi> hath a caſtle both for pleaſantneſſe, largeneſſe, munition and ſituation, almoſt incomparable: for ſituation (I ſay) both by Arte and Nature impregnable. <hi>Pautruy, Chaſtillon, Cormery, Beaulieu,</hi> and other cities of this Dukedome, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Belleforeſt,</hi> vnto whom I referre the Reader.</p>

Howbeit this inconuenience is no diſgrace to the Citie, nor diſcourageth Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers to frequent it: for the fruitfulneſſe and faire beautie of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince makes it amiable, and the excellent temper of the aire, populous: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for plentie of Wheat, Wine, and other neceſſaries for mans life, to no Prouince inferiour: for it is all ſhadie, and full of Woods, Vineyards, Riuers, Brooks, Pooles and Fountaines: ſo that Nature hath infuſed a wonderfull fatneſſe into this ſoile, with ſuch a temper of heat vpon the hilles neere about the citie, as cauſeth their Vineyards exceedingly to proſper. Wherefore this Prouince participating with <hi>Le Beaulſe</hi> and <hi>Salloigne,</hi> excelleth them both in their owne commodities. For abounding with Wheat no leſſe than <hi>Le Beaulſe,</hi> it farre ſurpaſſeth theſame in Wines, in other kinds of graine, and in plenty of water.

Wherefore that part of <hi>Le Beaulſe</hi> wherein <hi>Blois</hi> is ſituate, hath more abundance of wood and water than the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due; and the frontiers of <hi>Salloigne</hi> next adioyning may aſcribe their fruitfulneſſe to the good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of this territory. Neither can the olde ſaid ſaw, That it is beſt dwelling in <hi>Salloigne,</hi> and beſt inheriting in <hi>Le Baulſe,</hi> be ſeuerally, but iointly applied to <hi>Blois.</hi> That the aire is moſt holſome and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, I appeale to multitudes of great and honourable perſonages, who being oppreſſed with moſt grieuous diſeaſes, do repaire eſpecially to this Prouince for the recouery of their health. Yea the Kings children are nurſed &amp; trained vp in the city of <hi>Blois:</hi> for which cauſe it is called <hi>The Kings city.</hi> Amongſt the rarities of this prouince, one there is that can hardly be found in the whole Kingdome beſides, namely a veine of that earth, which is commonly called <hi>Terra Lemnia</hi> or <hi>Sigillata,</hi> being of the ſame force and efficacie with the true earth of <hi>Lemnos.</hi> All this deſcription we haue taken out of <hi>Belleforeſt.</hi>

The very ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it hath from <hi>Vareille</hi> (which ſtands a mile from <hi>Souterane</hi>) to the foreſaid riuer.

The principall citie of the higher prouince called <hi>Limoges</hi> is accounted one of the moſt famous and ancient cities of all <hi>France:</hi> ſituate partly in a valley towards the riuer of <hi>Vienne,</hi> and the towne and church of <hi>S.

It is ſtrongly fortified with walles and ditches, and abounds with water deriued from a notable Fountaine in the higheſt part of the citie, which ſerues likewiſe both to water their horſes, and to clenſe their ſtreets. But the ruines of the ancient walles, yet ſtanding in the next Vineyards, do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that the Citie in times paſt, was much larger than at this preſent.

The Francks alſo miſerably afflicted it. After them <hi>Charles Martell</hi> laid it waſte. And laſtly, the Engliſh made ſpoile thereof. Notwithſtanding at this time, for the bigneſſe, it is accounted one of the richeſt cities in the whole Kingdome; being very well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and gouerned in regard of the Court of Parliament there, as likewiſe the authoritie of the Vicount, the Kings Eſchequer, and the aſſembly of the Conſuls in Merchants affaires, which they commonly call The Burſe.

At what time the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> Lieutenant for the French King tooke it by force of armes. The townes of <hi>Calais, Guiſnes,</hi> and <hi>Ardres</hi> the Engliſh from time to time haue furniſhed with able gariſons.

But the Docke or place for building ſhips (called <hi>Nauale Geſſoriacum,</hi> which <hi>Bilibaldus</hi> falſely affirmes to be <hi>Gaunt</hi>) I thinke rather to be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellum,</hi> now named <hi>Caſſell.</hi> Some by another name call it <hi>Petreſſa</hi> and <hi>Scalas,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Scales.</hi> Moreouer, by the ſituation of <hi>Boulongne</hi> one may eaſily coniecture, whether it were <hi>Portus Iccius</hi> or no. Wherein that no man may doubt, let vs learne this one thing out of <hi>Strabo,</hi> That the ſea between <hi>Portus Iccius</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> was iuſt 320. <hi>ſtadia</hi> or furlongs ouer: which make in all 40. miles. But the later Maps containe betweene <hi>Boulongne</hi> and <hi>Douer</hi> 17. Engliſh, which are longer than Italian miles, and from <hi>Calais</hi> 18. Whereby it is manifeſt, that from <hi>Boulongne</hi> to <hi>Douer</hi> it is but a very ſhort cut: wherefore <hi>Portus Geſſoriacus</hi> the hauen, and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uale Geſſoriacum</hi> the docke, are not all one: which docke whoſo thinketh ſtood where <hi>Calais</hi> now ſtands, I will not greatly contradict him.

            <p>This very place of <hi>Boulongne</hi> is deſcribed by <hi>Arnoldus Ferronius</hi> (who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the French hiſtory of <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> till his owne time) in maner following.

Neere vnto this Frierie, which is not farre from the ſea, there is a very commodious place to paſſe for <hi>England.</hi> It is diſtant from the higher <hi>Boulongne</hi> about 100. paſes or ſomewhat more. But <hi>Boulongne</hi> the higher is inuironed with moſt ſtrong walles, and with high ditches compaſsing the walles. All this region is full of that ſand, which thoſe that dwell on the coaſt call hot ſand. Whereupon they will haue the name of <hi>Boulongne</hi> to be deriued of the French word that ſignifies ſuch kinde of ſand, notwithſtanding we know it out of <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> to be an ancient name.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He name of <hi>Picardie,</hi> as all that write of <hi>France</hi> do affirme not to be ancient; ſo the originall or deriuation thereof none of them can render. <hi>Caenalis</hi> dares not ſay, that it was ſo called of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardes. <hi>Belleforest</hi> flatly denies it, ſuppoſing the Picardes to be ſomewhat ancienter than the Begardes. Some thinke that they were ſo named of the warlike weapon called the Pike; which, as they imagine, was here firſt inuented. Certaine it is, that the prouince of <hi>Picardy</hi> was larger in times paſt: for we reade that <hi>Artois,</hi> with a part of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as farre as the riuer <hi>Lis,</hi> and the countie of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> were all comprehended vnder the name of <hi>Picardy.</hi> The region which is now properly called <hi>Picardy,</hi> extends not ſo farre as the Map it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This Region is part of <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> whilom inhabited by the Ambiani, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louaci, and Veromandui, or (as <hi>Ptolemey</hi> calles them) Romandui. The riuer <hi>Somme,</hi> which ſome thinke to be <hi>Ptolemey</hi> his Phrudis, refreſheth the wole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and makes it moſt fertile of all kinde of graine, and the townes and cities to abound with all neceſſaries: for it yeeldeth ſuch plentie of wheat, as it is called by an vſuall prouerbe, The Barne or Granarie of <hi>Paris.</hi> It hath no vineyards; which defect ſome thinke is rather to be imputed to the ſloth of the inhabitants, than to the intemperature either of the ſoile, or of the climate.</p>
            <p>The cities here, of principall note, are <hi>Amiens,</hi> in Latine <hi>Ambianum,</hi> famous both for antiquitie and the Epiſcopall ſea. It is enuironed around with the riuer <hi>Somme.</hi> Wherefore ſome fondly thinke it to be named <hi>Ambianum, ab ambitu aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> becauſe it is compaſſed with waters. It is one of the ſtrongeſt townes in all <hi>France.</hi> The vulgar ſuppoſe it to haue beene built by the ſouldiers of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. Vnder the dioceſſe of <hi>Amiens</hi> is <hi>Abbeuile,</hi> the name whereof is new, as appeareth by the deriuation, which in Latine is <hi>Abbatis villa,</hi> that is, The Abbats towne: for out of an Abbey it increaſed at length to the greatneſſe and forme of a citie. It is now the head citie of the county <hi>Ponthieu;</hi> which region is ſo called, <hi>à multitudine pontium,</hi> of the multitude of bridges; becauſe it is in diuers places peſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Marſhes and Fennes. <hi>Picquenie</hi> ſtands in this prouince alſo; built as the common ſort imagine by one <hi>Pignon</hi> a principall ſouldier of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. Likewiſe in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ermandois</hi> you haue the towne of <hi>S. Quintins,</hi> which many ſuppoſe to haue beene <hi>Augusta <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eromanduorum,</hi> being the ancient ſeat of the Earles of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandois,</hi> and the head of that region. <hi>Peronne</hi> ſo often ſpoiled in warres, who can be ignorant of? <hi>Guiſe</hi> alſo ſeemes to be a Fort againſt <hi>Lutzenburgh.</hi> Hence the Guiſian familie deriue their name.

            <p>In a little French pamphlet intitled <hi>Chemins de France,</hi> or the wayes of <hi>France, Picardy</hi> is diuided into three parts; The Lower, The Higher, and <hi>Picardy</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called: wherein are contained the Regions of <hi>

If we may credit <hi>Belleforeſt,</hi> it beareth ſugar about the towne of <hi>Yeres. Manna</hi> is here gathered, as the ſame authour affirmeth. The principall cities of this prouince are <hi>Maſsilia,</hi> commonly <hi>Marſeille,</hi> which was the ancient <hi>Ionica Colonia,</hi> of the Phocaean Greeks, being as <hi>Caeſar</hi> 5. <hi>Ciuil.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, compaſſed by the ſea on three ſides; and on the fourth ſide, hauing a paſſage to the land. <hi>Strabo</hi> writes, that the hauen is in forme of a Theater, and that within compaſſe thereof they haue docks for the building, and a ſtorehouſe for the furniſhing of ſhips. Here was a temple of the Epheſian <hi>Diana,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Apollo Delphicus.</hi> The citizens were treble-tongued, ſpeaking Greeke, Latine, and French, as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> reporteth out of <hi>Varro.</hi> Of this citie reade more largely in the 43. booke of <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> and in a Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricke ſpeech vttered before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great by <hi>Anonymus</hi> or one vnnamed.

Now it may well be called ſingle <hi>Arelas,</hi> looking of a farre other ſhape, and all ſituate vpon that ſide of the riuer which is towards <hi>Italie.</hi> This, <hi>Ammianus</hi> makes the renowme of many cities. And <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſaith, that heere was a Romane colonie planted by <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor his father. <hi>Procopius</hi> affirmes, that it was heretofore the head citie of the Burgundians. Next followes <hi>Aquae Sextiae,</hi> ſo called (ſaith <hi>Strabo</hi>) becauſe that very <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> which ſubdued <hi>Salyes,</hi> built this citie after his owne name, and after the name of certaine hot bathes in the ſame place. Now it is corruptly called <hi>Aix.</hi> Theſe bathes <hi>Strabo</hi> in his time ſuppoſeth to haue turned colde, and ſo <hi>Robert Caenalis</hi> at this preſent affirmeth, that they haue loſt their ancient vertue. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole prouince is here reſident. Of this citie <hi>Gabriel Simeonius</hi> writeth, that he neuer ſaw either a more pleaſant place, or a more courteous people. Then haue you the citie <hi>Cabellio,</hi> now called <hi>Cauaillon. Taraſcon</hi> retaining ſtill the ancient name. <hi>Carpentoracte</hi> commonly <hi>Carpentras. Vaſio</hi> now <hi>Voiton:</hi> the ſame with <hi>Forum Vocontiorum,</hi> as ſome thinke. <hi>Taurentum</hi> and <hi>Telo Martius,</hi> which ſome now interpret to be <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. Forum Iulij,</hi> now <hi>Frejus. Olbia</hi> which perhaps is <hi>Yeres. Antipolis, Antibe. Seguſteron, Ciſteron. Vintium, Venze. Glanatica, Glandeues. Dinia, Digne. Tecolata</hi> thought to be <hi>S. Maximines. Grinicenſis, Graſſe.</hi> All famous for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie. Moreouer, here is the towne of <hi>S. Baume,</hi> ſituate vpon a craggie hill, in which is a caue; where, the inhabitants hold opinion, that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did penance, and ended her dayes. Likewiſe at the mouth of <hi>Rhoſne</hi> the reader may ſee on the one ſide the field called <hi>La Craux;</hi> and on the other ſide <hi>La Camargo</hi> This laſt named (they ſay) is miraculouſly fertile of wheat. And <hi>Belleforeſt</hi> thinks it to be called <hi>Camargo, à caſtris Marij,</hi> of the campe of <hi>Marius</hi> here pitched. Whereas the other named <hi>La Craux,</hi> is out of meaſure bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, yeelding nought but ſtones: for which cauſe it is by ancient Writers moſt aptly called <hi>Campus Lapideus,</hi> or The ſtonie field. The iſles adiacent to this prouince are the Stoechades, diſperſed, as <hi>Pomponius</hi> writeth, from the ſhore of <hi>Liguria</hi> or <hi>Genoa</hi> as farre as <hi>Marſeille. Plinie</hi> makes them three in number, naming ech. And <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith there are three of importance, and two ſmall ones, not worthy to be mentioned. About theſe iſles growes moſt excellent Corrall, as <hi>Plinie</hi> witneſſeth, which <hi>Belleforest</hi> reporteth ſtill to continue. In commendation of this prouince, <hi>Petrus Quinqueranus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sens,</hi> hath written a peculiar volume.</p>
            <p>On this ſide the riuer <hi>Durance,</hi> this Region bordereth vpon that part of the Popes iuriſdiction, which is commonly called <hi>Conte de Venacin,</hi> in Latine <hi>Comitatus Venuxinus,</hi> and <hi>Veneticus,</hi> wherein ſtands the Citie and Vniuerſitie of <hi>Auignon,</hi> which in times paſt was the Papall ſea, namely from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fift in the yeere 1300. till <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſecond, for the ſpace of 60. yeeres. <hi>Petrarch</hi> then called it The French and Weſterne <hi>Babylon.</hi> Beſides other notable things in this citie, ſeuen there are, ſeuen times told, right worthy the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; namely, ſeuen Palaces, ſeuen Hoſpitals, ſeuen Pariſhes, ſeuen Nunries, ſeuen Colleges, ſeuen Frie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſeuen gates. Not farre from hence is the valley of <hi>Chiſa</hi> at the head of the riuer <hi>Sorgues,</hi> a place ſo highly magnified by <hi>Petrarch,</hi> as he often calles it his <hi>Helicon</hi> and <hi>Pernaſſus.</hi> This he made choiſe of as an hermitage to weane himſelfe from worldly cogitations. A man (in my conceit) not of the ordinary caſt of Writers, and whom I may boldly and deſeruedly call, The Chriſtian <hi>Seneca.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE bounds of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in times paſt extended much farther, for it comprehended in a maner all the whole region lying betweene the riuer <hi>Rhene,</hi> and <hi>Scheld,</hi> and the mountaine <hi>Vogaſus.</hi> All which was diuided into the higher, and the lower. The lower <hi>Lorrain</hi> contained <hi>Brabant, Haſpengow, Guelders,</hi> and <hi>Cleue.</hi> In the higher were the Biſhopricke of <hi>Liege,</hi> with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Lutzenburg,</hi> and <hi>Limburg:</hi> as likewiſe the duchy of <hi>Maeſland,</hi> the countie Palantine vpon <hi>Sur,</hi> and the territorie of <hi>Hundſruge:</hi> together with this preſent Dukedome of <hi>Lorrain</hi> retaining as yet the ancient name <hi>Lotharingia,</hi> impoſed by <hi>Lotharius</hi> ſonne to <hi>Ludouicus Pius,</hi> vnto whoſe ſhare it befell: lying in the midſt between <hi>Weſtraſia</hi> (or as ſome vnskilfully call it <hi>Noaſtria</hi>) which fell to <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Auſtraſia</hi> to <hi>Lewis Lotharius</hi> Brethren. This therefore I thinke not amiſſe more largely to deſcribe, not in mine owne wordes, but in the wordes of <hi>Symphorianus Campeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> ſometimes a famous Phyſition of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> LORRAIN (ſaith he) ioineth Eaſt vpon <hi>Alſatia,</hi> commonly <hi>Elſas,</hi> South vpon <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Weſt vpon <hi>Champaigne,</hi> &amp; North it is bounded vpon the Foreſt <hi>Arduenna.</hi> This region albeit compaſſed with loftie Alpes, is notwithſtanding ſo fat and fertile, as it need no ſupply from the neighbour-prouinces: it abounds with cattell great and ſmall, with meadowes, corne, wine, fiſhpooles, high woods, healthfull bathes, ſaltpits, yron, copper, lead, tinne, ſiluer, precious ſtones, looking glaſſes, Calcidons, and is watered by ſundrie riuers: foure whereof are famous aboue the reſt. <hi>Moſa</hi> the firſt of theſe foure ſpringing out of mount <hi>Vogeſus</hi> (of which mountaine a great and a good part of <hi>Lorraine</hi> is named <hi>Le bois,</hi> and <hi>Le foreſt de Voige</hi>) and running along by <hi>Neufchaſteau,</hi> a towne very commodious both for pleaſant ſituation, and wholeſome ayer: diuideth the duchie of <hi>Barre</hi> from <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and caſteth it ſelfe into one of the chanels of <hi>Rhene,</hi> before it falleth into the ſea. <hi>Moſella</hi> the ſecond beginneth Southeaſt, not far from the towne of <hi>Rimere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> wherein is a monaſtery of Nunnes, all gentlewomen, endowed with large reuenues. About ſix miles from hence are certaine hot-bathes whereunto reſort great multitudes of people to cure themſelues of ſundrie diſeaſes. Then runnes it along with ſwift ſtreames to the townes of <hi>Eſpinall, Charmes, Toul</hi> (which in olde time was called <hi>Leuca</hi>) and <hi>Mediomatrices,</hi> now called <hi>Metz:</hi> not farre from whence it falls into the <hi>Rhene,</hi> at a city of <hi>Germany</hi> called of olde <hi>Confluentia,</hi> and now <hi>Cobolentz.</hi> Betweene theſe two riuers neere the towne of <hi>Vitell,</hi> is a double fountaine ſeuered like a mans noſethrills, from whence the ſmall riuer <hi>Vena</hi> iſſueth: which ſometimes is ſandy, and ſometimes miry, and for the moſt part very vnſeemely and forlorne: the waters whereof are commonly dried vp in <hi>Iune,</hi> except the pooles, which the ſwelling and violent ſtreames haue made ſo deepe. <hi>Murtha</hi> the third riuer falling from certaine rockes of ſiluer-mines, holdeth on his courſe through the valley of <hi>S. Didier,</hi> wherein is <hi>S. Godeberts</hi> fountaine, which is generally reported to be medicinable for many diſeaſes. The ſaid riuer runnes along by the towne of <hi>S. Didier,</hi> and then by the townes of <hi>Raon</hi> and <hi>Luneuill:</hi> all which both for naturall ſituation, and for rampiers, and walles are places of ſingular defence. Then followes the towne of <hi>S. Nicholas</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally famous both for abundance of marchandiſe, and multitudes of miracles. Lower downe the riuer ſtands <hi>Nancey,</hi> the principall towne of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> a place for munition, and fortification of great importance. Firſt it is compaſſed with two ditches of exceeding depth, and a double wall: alſo it hath foure moſt admirable bulwarks, with plenty of warlike engins and artillery. <hi>Murtha</hi> falles into <hi>Moſell.</hi> And <hi>Sartha</hi> the fourth riuer running along the confines of <hi>Weſtereich,</hi> a prouince ſubiect to <hi>Lorraine</hi> towards the Eaſt, holdeth on his courſe by the townes of <hi>Sarburg, Saralben, Sarprucke,</hi> with others, and then falles into <hi>Moſell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whereas <hi>Lorraine</hi> aboundeth all ouer with ſpeciall commodities; many of them we will omit, and ſpeake only of the moſt principall. Firſt therefore the mountaines of this prouince doe in all kind of mineralls excell euen the <hi>Pyreney</hi> mountaines: wherein, not to ſpeake of the reſt, there are diuers ſiluer-mines, ſo abounding with that kinde of mettall, as it is incredible what commoditie it yeelds to the whole countrey.</p>
            <p>There are alſo ſalt-mines, out of which is digged moſt pure, ſauorie, and ſnow-white ſalt: which yeeldeth yerely to the Duke, all charges deducted, 100000. francks.</p>
            <p>Heere is found likewiſe a kind of matter, whereof they make looking glaſſes and drinking glaſſes, the beſt, by all mens confeſſion, in <hi>Europe:</hi> nor is there in any place the like to be had.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Calcidons</hi> of ſo extraordinarie bigneſſe, that I my ſelfe ſaw at the Biſhops of <hi>Toul,</hi> a great cuppe made of one whole piece.</p>
            <p>Item, the <hi>Lazul</hi> (or <hi>Azure</hi> ſtone) repreſenting moſt excellent colours. A minerall out of which the miners raiſe exceeding gaine.</p>
            <p>In the valley of <hi>Voige</hi> are fountaines (a matter memorable, and not to be omitted) ſo abounding with a kinde of pearles, and precious ſtones, as the greater part of <hi>Germanie</hi> doth vſe them: which all Lapidaries and Iewellers of other countries do not only approue, but alſo preferre before the ſtones and pearles of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a lake of foureteene miles in compaſſe, ſtored with carps of huge bigneſſe; for they are generally of three foot long, and a foot broad; which for pleaſantneſſe of taſte, are (in mine opinion) to be preferred before all other ſtanding-water-carps in <hi>Europe.</hi> The lake is fiſhed with nets euery third yeere; the fiſhing whereof (as euery man knowes) yeeldeth the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> 16000. francks.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, <hi>Lorrain</hi> aboundeth with wheat, wine, cattell of all ſorts, woods, excellent horſes, which ſurpaſſe the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh horſes in courage, the Spaniſh in ſwiftneſſe, and the Engliſh in ſtature. In briefe, for tall men and beautifull women; and all things neceſſary for mans life, it is inferiour to no other countrie. Thus farre <hi>Symphorianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Roſeus</hi> very lately wrote a large volume of the pedegree, and famous acts of the Dukes of <hi>Lorraine.</hi> And I my ſelfe in mine <hi>Itinerarium,</hi> or Iournall, haue publiſhed ſome things of this Region not vnwoorthie the remembrance.</p>

On the one ſide it is endowed with moſt large and fruitfull fields. VESOVL. It hath ſtrong walles, beautifull houſes, and faire vineyards. MOMBOSON, IVSSEY, and PALMA ſtanding vpon the riuer <hi>Dubis,</hi> or <hi>Doux.</hi> PORT-SVR-SAONE, vpon the riuer <hi>Araris,</hi> or <hi>Saone,</hi> with CROMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAY, MONTGVSTIN, and FAVLCOGNEY. The cities of the lower <hi>Burgundie</hi> are: SALINS, a large citie, ſo named in regard of certaine ſalt and high fountaines; for here is excellent white ſalt made, which is carried hence in carts to the neighbour countries, and yeelds great reuenue to this region: SCODINGA, ſituate in a long ſtreight valley, extending in length betweene a double ridge of high mountaines, which beare vines in ſuch places as are moſt open to the Sunne: it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtrong, being fortified with two caſtles, and diuers loftie turrets. ARBOIS, ſeated in a moſt pleaſant ſoile, and abounding with all neceſſaries, eſpecially with excellent and durable wine. It hath large ſuburbs on all ſides. It is enuironed with ditches, but ſuch as they make gardens vpon. Round about it are mountaines of moſt beautifull proſpect, watered with cleare ſprings, and clad with fruitfull vines, and ſightly woods. It is called <hi>Arbois ab Arboribus,</hi> becauſe it is ſo planted with trees: POLIGNY a faire towne, fortified with ſtately walles and towers; the caſtle called <hi>Grimonia</hi> lying within it: and on the one ſide it hath mountaines of woods; and on the other ſide hilles ſet with vines, the wine whereof is principall good. PONTARLIER, ſituate in a low valley betweene two mountaines, on the bancke of <hi>Dubis.</hi> Not farre hence ſtands the ſtrong caſtle of <hi>Iura</hi> or <hi>Ioux,</hi> on the top of an exceeding high hill; ſo that for ſituation it is impregnable. NOZEROY, founded vpon an open hill, in the very nauell or midſt of this region. All the houſes in a maner are built of ſtone: the Prince of the countrey hath here a caſtle, called The Leaden caſtle, becauſe it is couered with lead. Here is a Faire kept foure times in the yere. In times paſt this towne, before it was walled, was named <hi>Nucillum,</hi> of the abundance of hazel-nuts that grew round about it. CHASTEL CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LON, built and named by the Emperour <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> both pleaſantly and ſtrongly ſituate. MONTMOROT, vpon a ſteepe mountaine planted with vines. ORGELET, abounding with merchandiſe. The inhabitants are induſtrious and painfull, and exerciſe themſelues in clothing. Their fields are barren, for they are full of hilles and craggie rocks; whereupon is grounded a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prouerbe, which ſaith, That <hi>Orgelet</hi> hath fields without graſſe, riuers without fiſh, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines without woods and groues. The cities of <hi>Dole,</hi> are firſt, DOLE it ſelfe, the head citie of the prouince, a nurſe of all learning, and eſpecially of the ciuill law, moſt pleaſantly ſituate vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Dubis,</hi> adorn'd with bridges, walles, and inuincible forts. The houſes, churches and ſchooles, both for greatneſſe and curious building are moſt delightfull to the beholders. QVINGEY, a moſt ancient towne, ſituate vpon the bancke of <hi>Louë.</hi> ORNANS, ſtanding alſo among high mountaines by the riuer <hi>Louë.</hi> LA LOY, a moſt ample village. ROCHFORT a pretie litle towne. VERCELLES with ruinous and deformed walles.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat part of <hi>France</hi> which the <hi>Aedui</hi> whilome enioyed is now called The Dukedome of <hi>Burgundie.</hi> It is limited North by <hi>Champaigne</hi> and <hi>Gaſtinois:</hi> Weſt, by <hi>Niuernois</hi> and <hi>Burbonnois:</hi> South, it borders vpon <hi>Lionnois:</hi> and Eaſt the riuer <hi>Rhoſne</hi> diuides it from <hi>Sauoy</hi> and the county of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> The head citie in times paſt was <hi>Auguſtodunum:</hi> but now <hi>Diuio,</hi> or <hi>Diuionum,</hi> as <hi>Gregory Turonenſis</hi> in his third booke calles it, or as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, <hi>Digion</hi> hath gotten the ſuperiority; for here the ſupreme court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the whole Dukedome is holden. It is ſeated on the bancke of <hi>Oſcarus</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Ouſch</hi>) a riuer abounding with fiſh, in a fertile and plentifull ſoile, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines adiacent yeelding ſtrong and excellent wines: as the ſaid <hi>Turonenſis</hi> reporteth, who moſt learnedly deſcribes it. Some thinke it was built by the Emperour <hi>Aurelian;</hi> but others affirme it to be much ancienter. It is a citie both by arte and nature moſt ſtrongly fortified againſt all hoſtile attempts, certaine new forts being lately added. <hi>Belna</hi> (commonly <hi>Beaulne</hi>) is the ſecond citie of the Dukedome, famous for the wines of <hi>Beaulne,</hi> which all men commend. This Citie is fairely built, being impregnable in regard of a Caſtle which <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth erected here. It hath an hoſpitall comparable for building to any Kings Palace. Here alſo is the ſeat of the high court of Chancery. In the territorie adiacent was built by Duke <hi>Otho</hi> about the yeere of our Lord 1098. the abbey of <hi>Cistertium;</hi> in a woody and clammy ſoile, which ſome thinke was ſo called in regard of certaine Ciſternes there digged. Vnder the iuriſdiction of this Monaſterie <hi>Belleforest</hi> reporteth, that there are 1800. other Monaſteries of Friers, and as many of Nunnes.</p>
            <p>Next followes <hi>Auguſtodunum</hi> (which ſome, though vpon no ſufficient grounds of antiquitie, ſuppoſe to haue beene called <hi>Bibracte</hi>) now <hi>Auttun.</hi> That this citie of ancient times was moſt large and populous, it is euident out of ſundry authours, and eſpecially out of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Here are yet extant mightie ruines of a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of Statues, Pillars, Water-chanels, Pyramides, and many other monuments of antiquitie. Likewiſe here are dayly digged vp coines, little veſſels, and other ſuch ancient fragments. This citie hath endured two memorable ouerthrowes: one by <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his French warres; and the other about the time of <hi>Galienus</hi> the Emperour. But it was afterward reedified by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as the Panegyrick of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius,</hi> calling it <hi>Flauiam Heduorum,</hi> doth teſtifie. And at this very day it is adorned with ſtately temples, and other buildings for publicke vſes.</p>
            <p>Then haue you <hi>Matiſcona Caeſaris,</hi> or <hi>Matiſconenſe caſtrum Antonini,</hi> where he placeth in garriſon the tenth Roman legion. It is now called <hi>Maſcon.</hi> Of olde it was graced with the title of an Earledome. It ioyneth the bancks of <hi>Araris</hi> by a bridge. Here, the Lords day of the Chriſtians began firſt to be hallowed, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radine</hi> reporteth out of the Edict of <hi>Guntram.</hi> The relation of the citie of <hi>Maſcon, Philip Bugnonius</hi> hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, and briefly ſet downe. <hi>Cabilonum,</hi> now <hi>Chalon,</hi> vpon the bancke of <hi>Araris</hi> alſo, anciently called <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandale,</hi> as reporteth <hi>Peter Sanjulian.</hi> By <hi>Antoninus</hi> the foureteenth Roman legion was here put in garriſon. It was of olde the royall ſeat of <hi>Guntram,</hi> which notwithſtanding afterward <hi>Lotharius</hi> ſonne to <hi>Ludouicus Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſo deſtroyed and aboliſhed with fire, as he left no mention at all of a citie: yet now it is very rich, and a place of great trafficke. Alſo toward the North you haue <hi>Semur,</hi> a faire towne built vpon an high ground. As like <hi>Caſtillon, Flauigni, Soloigne, Noiers,</hi> with others, the deſcription whereof, becauſe this page cannot well containe, I referre the Reader to <hi>Belleforeſt,</hi> a diligent Surueyer of theſe parts. Only one thing I will adde out of the foreſaid <hi>Sanjulian.</hi> He againſt the opinion of all other Writers, deriueth this word <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> not <hi>à burgis,</hi> that is, from the boroughs or incorporate townes built in this region, but from one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place called <hi>Burg Ogne.</hi> In the territorie of <hi>Langren</hi> about the riuer <hi>Tille,</hi> betweene <hi>Luz</hi> and <hi>Tille-castle,</hi> he ſaith there is a plaine which the inhabitants call by no other name but <hi>Val d'Ogne:</hi> where in times paſt ſtood a famous borough or city. Hence without all queſtion he affirmes, that the Burgundians, or as they are commonly called <hi>Burgognons,</hi> do borow their name; and holds thoſe Writers much deceiued, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, as vagabond people, to haue come out of <hi>Sarmatia, Scandia,</hi> or the fennes of <hi>Maeotis</hi> to inhabit this region; indeuouring to perſuade all men that they were the firſt and moſt ancient inhabiters of this countrey.</p>
            <p>The limits of <hi>Burgundie</hi> were larger in times paſt, as appeareth out of ſundrie authours. For ſome there are that bound it South by the Mediterran ſea; Eaſt, by the Alpes and the riuer <hi>Rhene;</hi> North, by mount <hi>Vogeſus;</hi> and Weſt, by the riuer of <hi>Loire,</hi> and <hi>Seine.</hi> Then, claſsicke Writers record, that it was gouerned by Kings, whoſe royall ſeat was <hi>Arles.</hi> It was diuided into the Duchie and Countie of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> about the yeere 1034. as the Chronicle of <hi>Aemilius</hi> teſtifieth.

The ancient is that of <hi>Beroſus,</hi> which he circumſcribeth by the <hi>Rhene,</hi> the Ocean, the riuer <hi>Tanais,</hi> the Euxine ſea, and the riuer <hi>Danubius.</hi> That of middle ages is the ſame which <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Ptolemey,</hi> and <hi>Plinie,</hi> all of one time acknowledged: whereof, becauſe it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently knowen out of the authours themſelues, I hold it needleſſe in this place to make any deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But <hi>Germanie</hi> as it is now taken, we do confine by the German or Dutch tongue; which learned <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> in his volume of the antiquities of nations, moſt wittily and learnedly ſheweth to be the ancienteſt language in the world. Wherfore all thoſe countries which at this day vſe the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, we comprehend vnder the name of <hi>Germany.</hi> And ſo the greateſt length thereof ſtretcheth from <hi>Calais</hi> on the Weſt to the riuer <hi>Viſtula</hi> or <hi>VVixel</hi> Eaſtward: and the largeſt bredth from the German and Baltick ſeas to the Alpes. The names of the ſeuerall regions are theſe, <hi>Flanders</hi> (the moſt Weſterly) <hi>Brabant, Zeland, Holland, Friſland, Denmarke, Meckleburgh, Pomerland, Pruſsia,</hi> which extendeth beyond the riuer <hi>Viſtula</hi> towards the Baltick ſea: as likewiſe the ancient and new Marqueſates, <hi>Saxonie, VVeſtphalia, Gelders, Cleueland, Iuliers,</hi> the Biſhopricke of <hi>Colen, Heſſen, Turingen, Miſnia, Luſatia, Sileſia, Morauia, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Franconia,</hi> the Biſhopricke of <hi>Mentz, Lutzenburg,</hi> the Biſhopricke of <hi>Triers,</hi> the Countie Palatine, <hi>Elſas, VVertenberg, Sueuia, Bauaria, Auſtria, Stiria, Carinthia, Tirolis,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> next vnto <hi>France.</hi> There be alſo more names of pettie regions, but ſuch as are either of no great moment, or comprehended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former. And albeit <hi>Bohemia</hi> ſpeaketh not the German but the Sclauonian tongue, yet becauſe it is ſituate in the midſt of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and the King thereof is one of the Prince-electours, it is alſo num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongſt the German prouinces.</p>
            <p>This countrey of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which for the preſent is adorned with the title of the Roman Empire, is ſo repleniſhed with beautifull and ſtrong cities, caſtles, villages and inhabitants, as it is no whit inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to <hi>Italie, France,</hi> or <hi>Spaine:</hi> for corne, wine, and riuers abounding with fiſh, it may compare with the moſt fruitfull regions Here are fountaines of water, hot bathes, and ſalt-mines in abundance: and for plentie of mettals, namely, gold, ſiluer, lead, tinne, braſſe, and iron, no countrey ſhall euer go beyond it. Moreouer, you ſhall no where finde more courteous and ciuill behauiour, more honeſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attire, more skill and furniture for the warres, nor greater ſtore of nobilitie. This is the place that whilome (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> affirmeth) was either darkened with woods, or drowned with fennes. <hi>Such changes can ſucceeding times affourd,</hi> as ſaith the Poet.</p>
            <p>Of late Writers it hath beene diligently deſcribed by <hi>Beatus Rhenanus, Munster</hi> in his Coſmography, <hi>Franciſcus Irenicus, Iohannes Auentinus</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Lyonnois:</hi> Briefly by <hi>Bilibaldus Pirkeimerus, Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Bohemus Aubames: Gerardus Nouiomagus, Conradus Peutingerus, Conradus Celtes</hi> a Poet, <hi>Iacobus VVimfelingius</hi> of <hi>Sletſtade, Aimon</hi> in the beginning of his French ſtorie, and <hi>Henry Pantalion</hi> at the entrance of his firſt booke of <hi>Proſopographia. Sebaſtian Brand</hi> hath ſet downe many iourneys, diſtances of places, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of riuers in this countrey. The riuer <hi>Rhene</hi> is deſcribed by <hi>Bernard Mollerus</hi> in verſe, and by <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Gruberus</hi> in proſe. <hi>Iohn Herold</hi> hath written two ſhort Treatiſes of this region: one of the Romans moſt ancient ſtations in olde <hi>Germanie;</hi> and another of certeine colonies of theirs on the ſhore of <hi>Rhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. Gaſpar Bruſchius</hi> publiſhed a volume of the monaſteries of <hi>Germanie.</hi> Of ancient writers <hi>Cornelius Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> moſt exactly deſcribed it in a peculiar Treatiſe: whereon <hi>Andraeas Althamerus, Iodocus VVillichius,</hi> and lately <hi>Iuſtus Lipſius</hi> haue written moſt learned Commentaries. Diuers other Writers of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which we haue not as yet ſeene, are reckened vp by <hi>Francis Irenicus,</hi> in the firſt booke and ſecond chapter of his Expoſition of <hi>Germanie.</hi> But here I thinke it not amiſſe to alledge the teſtimonie of <hi>Laonicus Chalco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condylas</hi> a ſtranger, namely of <hi>Athens,</hi> concerning this countrey and the inhabitants. Thus therefore he writeth in his ſecond booke: <q rend="inline">This nation is gouerned with better lawes than any other of thoſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or peoples that inhabit towards the North or Weſt. It hath many noble and flouriſhing cities, which vſe their owne lawes, moſt agreeable to equitie. It is diuided into ſundry principalities, and is ſubiect to Prieſts and Biſhops adhering to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The moſt famous and wel-gouerned cities in the vpper and lower <hi>Germanie,</hi> are <hi>Norinberg</hi> a rich city, <hi>Straſburg, Hamburg,</hi> &amp;c. The nation is very populous and mighty; ruleth farre and wide all the world ouer; and in greatneſſe is ſecond to the Scythians or Tartars. Wherefore if they were at concord and vnder one Prince, then might they well be deemed inuincible, and the moſt puiſſant of nations. As touching their bodies, they are verie healthfull, and want nothing. Nor is there any nation that I know gouerned by better lawes. Thus much and more concerning this people and countrey, who liſt may reade in the ſame authour.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Table repreſenteth not all the Lower <hi>Germanie,</hi> but only that part which King <hi>Philip,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, challenged by right of inheritance. And it conteineth theſe 17. Prouinces; the Dukedomes of <hi>Brabant, Limburgh, Lutzenburg,</hi> and <hi>Guelders;</hi> the Earledomes of <hi>Flanders, Artois, Henault, Holland, Zeland, Namur, Zutfen;</hi> the Marqueſat of the ſacred Empire; the Signiories of <hi>Friſland, Mechlin, Vtreight, Oueriſſell,</hi> and <hi>Groemingen.</hi> Regions as ciuill and as well manured as any in the world; wherein (according to <hi>Guicciardin</hi>) are to the number of 208. cities fortified with walles, rampiers, or ditches; and villages with churches aboue 6300, beſides a great number of hamlets, caſtles and forts. And this tract (beginning from the Eaſt maretine part at the riuer <hi>Amiſus,</hi> commonly <hi>Eems,</hi> the bound hereof towards the Ocean) hath theſe bordering Princes: the Earle of Eaſt <hi>Friez,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Munster,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cleue,</hi> the Archbiſhops of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> and the French King, along the Southweſterne ſhore as farre as the riuer <hi>Aa,</hi> the extreame Weſterne bound of theſe Prouinces. The aire, though it may ſeeme ouer-moiſt, is notwithſtanding moſt healthfull, and agreeable to the conſtitution and digeſtion of the inhabitants; who are heere very long liued eſpecially in <hi>Kempenland,</hi> the Northermoſt part of <hi>Brabant.</hi> It is euery where watered with riuers; and ſufficiently adorned with woods and groues, either for paſtime of hunting, or beautifull proſpect. Mountaines it hath none, ſaue only about <hi>Lutzenburg, Namur,</hi> and in <hi>Henault,</hi> where it riſeth in ſome places into hilles. It aboundeth with corne and fruits of all ſorts, and medicinable herbs. Here alſo groweth great plentie of that graine, which commonly is called <hi>Buckwey,</hi> but the people corruptly pronounce it <hi>Bockwey;</hi> as if you would ſay, The Beech-herbe: for the ſeed or graine (albeit leſſe in forme) is three-ſquare, altogether like the nut of the Beech. So as it may truely be called Beech-maſt, or if you will <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>. Whether this ſimple were knowen of ancient times, let Herbaliſts enquire. Howbeit, in ſome ſandie places, which the inhabitants, in regard of abundance of heath or linge, call Heath-ground; as in <hi>Kempenland</hi> the North part of <hi>Brabant,</hi> it growes not in ſuch plentie. But this kinde of heath yeeldes ſuch excellent feed for cattell, as (by the confeſſion of neighbour-countries) their fleſh is as pleaſant and delectable to a mans taſte, as any other. This region I ſuppoſe, that <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 17. booke and 4. chapter moſt truely deſcribeth, when he ſaith: <hi>What better feed than the paſtures of</hi> Germanie? <hi>And yet vnder a thin flag you haue immediatly a mould of barren ſand.</hi> It bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no creatures hurtfull to mankinde.</p>
            <p>All the foreſaid regions, the greateſt part of ſtrangers (moſt ignorantly miſtaking part for the whole) call by the name of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the inhabitants Flemings, whereas <hi>Flanders</hi> is but a part only, and but one Prouince of the ſeuenteene; as in the Table you may plainly ſee. Theſe therefore are in as great an error, as if a man, to ſignifie <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhould name <hi>Caſtilia, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluzia,</hi> or any other particular Prouince: or ſpeaking of <hi>Italie,</hi> ſhould mention <hi>Tuſcan</hi> or <hi>Calabria</hi> &amp;c. or diſcourſing of the whole kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould nominate only <hi>Normandy</hi> or <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo ſhould imagine himſelfe to haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all <hi>Spaine,</hi> all <hi>Italie,</hi> or all <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe regions <hi>Iohn Goropius Becanus</hi> in his <hi>Becceſelanis</hi> hath moſt learnedly deſcribed, as likewiſe <hi>Peter Diuaeus</hi> of <hi>Louaine,</hi> and <hi>Hubert Thomas</hi> of <hi>Liege. Iohannes Caluetus Stella,</hi> a Spaniard, writ in his owne language a Iournall of King <hi>Philips</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe thorow all theſe Prouinces; wherein you ſhall finde many particulars worth the reading, that giue great light to the knowledge of theſe countries and cities. But whoſo deſires to haue more full and abſolute inſtructions of theſe places, let him peruſe <hi>Guicciardin;</hi> and he will then thinke, that he hath not read of theſe Prouinces, but ſeene them with his eyes. Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo <hi>Dauid Chitraeus</hi> in his Saxon hiſtorie hath written both largely and learnedly of the ſame argument.</p>
            <p>Whereas the inhabitants in moſt places ſpeake both the Dutch and French languages, and the countrey for traffique and other occaſions is frequented by Spaniards and ſtrangers of ſundry nations; hence it is that diuers cities, townes, and riuers, are called by more names than one: for euery man calles them according to his owne language, by a name much differing from the proper name vſed by the inhabitants. The ignorance of which multiplicitie of names hath made ſome authours (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not to be diſcommended) to fall into intolerable errours: and amongſt the reſidue, <hi>Dominicus Niger</hi> in his Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie; who puts downe <hi>Anuerſa</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Tarauanna;</hi> and <hi>Antorpia</hi> (which notwithſtanding in the copie printed by <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Peterſon</hi> he corruptly calles <hi>Antropicia</hi>) he placeth vpon the banke of <hi>Tabuda,</hi> thirty leagues from <hi>Tarauanna;</hi> whereas all men know, that <hi>Antorpia</hi> and <hi>Anuerſa</hi> ſignifie one and the ſame citie of <hi>Antwerpe.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Machelen</hi> and <hi>Malines, Leodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> and <hi>Liege, Nouiomagum</hi> and <hi>Nieumeghen, Traiectum</hi> on the <hi>Maeſe</hi> and <hi>Trait</hi> (for which he falſly writes <hi>Trecia</hi>) he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be two ſeuerall townes, ech couple; whereas in very deed they ſignifie but one. The citie <hi>Raremutium</hi> alſo he moſt groſly affirmeth to be called <hi>Liege:</hi> and in another place he will needs haue the ſame <hi>Raremutium</hi> to be named <hi>Rhamon:</hi> but by his deſcription I coniecture, that he meanes by his <hi>Raremutium</hi> and <hi>Rhamon</hi> nothing els but the towne of <hi>Ruermond.</hi> So <hi>Rhenen</hi> a citie of Guelders ſtanding on the banke of the riuer <hi>Rhene,</hi> in regard of the affinitie of name, he takes to be all one with the Biſhopricke of <hi>Rhemes</hi> in the Prouince of <hi>Champaigne</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> But being vtterly vnacquainted with the ſtate of our countries, his errors may ſeeme the more pardonable. Howbeit, leſt others, ſtudious in Geography, ſhould fall into the like abſurdities, I thought good to annex vnto this page the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſynonymas or ſundry names of certaine particular places.</p>

            <head>The Dukedome of LVTZENBVRG.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His region as we ſee many others, is ſo named of <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall citie: but why it ſhould be thus called, we cannot eaſilie coniecture. At firſt it went vnder the title of an Earledome, and afterward was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to the dignitie of a Dukedome, and ſo till this preſent continueth. Some ſay it was thus aduanced by <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> King of the Romans; others, by <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth: howbeit <hi>Conradus Vercerius</hi> aſcribes it to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth, the first Romane Emperour of that family. I finde in ancient manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, that the first Earle of <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> was one <hi>Sigisfridus,</hi> and that he was the ſonne of <hi>Tacuinus</hi> Duke of <hi>Maeſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In former times <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> was part of <hi>Triers.</hi> It ſtretcheth from the wood <hi>Arduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to <hi>Moſella</hi> (a riuer by <hi>Auſonius</hi> much celebrated.) The countries bordering vpon this Prouince, are part of <hi>France, Loraigne, Metz, Triers, Mamure,</hi> and <hi>Liege.</hi> It is in most places mountainous and woodie; but here and there alſo well manured: and of late we ſee their woods euery where turned vp and conuerted into most fruitfull fields. The people are for the greatest part Dutch, and yet their countrie ioyneth hard vpon <hi>France,</hi> and they are accustomed to the language and faſhions of the <hi>French.</hi> This Dukedome conteineth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, as ſaith <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> ſeuentie of our Flemiſh miles. Within it are ſeuen Earledomes, many Baronies, and great ſtore of gentlemen. Cities there are with ſtone walles to the number of twentie three, beſides thoſe that the furie of warre hath layd deſolate: with <hi>1168.</hi> villages, and ſundrie castles of importance.</p>
            <p>The principall citie is called <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> or <hi>Lucemburg;</hi> for I find it both wayes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but without any choice: becauſe both the true maner of writing and the deriuation is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine. Some thinke of the riuer <hi>Elza</hi> running by this citie (which perhaps was <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his <hi>Alizontia</hi>) that it might be called <hi>Elzenburg,</hi> and corruptly <hi>Lelzenburg.</hi> Others referre it to the fabulous historie of the Inchantreſſe <hi>Meluſina.</hi> But my purpoſe is neither to proue nor diſproue ſuch opinions. Here reſideth the chiefe Counſell, and the highest Court of iustice. The citie is of ſufficient force, but vnequally ſituate: for ſtanding partly on a hill, and partly in a lowe and ſteepe valley, it appeares of a very vneuen ſhape. Then haue you <hi>Arlune</hi> ſtanding on the top of a hill, a towne very beautifull, where at this preſent are found ſundry monuments of antiquitie, which <hi>Count Peter Erneſtus</hi> hath cauſed to be tranſported to his ſtately Palace in the citie of <hi>Lutzenburg.</hi> Some are of opinion that the Moone in time past was here after a Gentiliſh maner adored, and that it was called <hi>Arlune, quaſi Ara lunae,</hi> that is, the altar of the moone. Others imagine, that theſe cities following borowed their names alſo from the reſidue of the planets; as <hi>Iuoſium</hi> (commonly <hi>Iuoix</hi>) from <hi>Ioue</hi> or <hi>Iupiter; Sathenacum</hi> (now <hi>Soleure</hi>) from <hi>Saturne; Virtonium</hi> (alias <hi>Verton</hi>) from <hi>Venus; Maruilla</hi> (or <hi>Maruille</hi>) from <hi>Mars; Malmedium (Malmedi)</hi> from <hi>Mercurie.</hi> Some interpret <hi>Malmedi, Montem maledictum,</hi> The accurſed mountaine; ſaying that it was ſo called, becauſe here the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> loſt his armie. Next followes <hi>Radema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherne.</hi> Alſo <hi>Thion-uille,</hi> on the banke of <hi>Moſella:</hi> it is the fortreſſe of the whole region, and a towne moſt defenſible against all hoſtile attempts. <hi>Grauenmachern</hi> and <hi>Conings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machern,</hi> two ſmall townes ſituate vpon the ſame riuer. <hi>Dechrij</hi> ſtands vpon the riuer <hi>Saur. Echternach,</hi> containing a famous Abbey. <hi>Vinden</hi> likewiſe. Alſo the towne of <hi>Baſtoigne,</hi> the principall mart of the whole region, ſtanding neere the wood <hi>Arduenna.</hi> Here you haue in like ſort, <hi>Naufchaſtelle, Danuiller, la Roche,</hi> and <hi>Durbis,</hi> townes not altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie to be mentioned: as likewiſe <hi>Sant Vit, Marche, Chiney,</hi> and <hi>Ferta.</hi> All which are more amply deſcribed by <hi>Guicciardin. Regino</hi> in his ſecond booke makes mention of mount <hi>Adromare</hi> about <hi>Thion-uille,</hi> where <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> was wont to ride a hunting.

It is watered with three famous riuers, namely <hi>Rhijne, Maeſe,</hi> and <hi>VVaele.</hi> It conteineth the countie of <hi>Zutphen</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion called <hi>De Veluvve.</hi> The <hi>Veluwe</hi> is almoſt an iſle, which being ſituate betweene a branch of <hi>Rhijn</hi> that runnes by <hi>Arnhem,</hi> and the riuer <hi>Yſſel,</hi> ſtretcheth to the Suyder ſea; it is meanly fruitfull and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together void of woods, mountaines, and hilles. Some thinke that the inhabitants of this place were woont to be called Caninfates.</p>
            <p>The Dukedome of <hi>Guelders</hi> hath two and twentie cities compaſſed with walles and ditches, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue three hundred villages. <hi>Nieumegen</hi> vpon the <hi>VVaele</hi> is the Metropolitan; a citie very populous, and gallantly built, &amp; famous in regard of the mint that is there. The greateſt part of the citizens vſing trade of merchandize are exceeding rich. The territory of this citie is adorned with the title of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Next followes <hi>Ruremonde,</hi> ſituate where the riuer <hi>Roer</hi> falles into the <hi>Maeſe.</hi> It hath in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance beene a Biſhopricke. <hi>Zutphen,</hi> at the mouth of the riuer <hi>Berkel,</hi> where it diſchargeth it ſelfe into <hi>Yſſel.</hi> It beares the title of an Earledome. It hath a rich College of Canons, and is vnder the iuriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Munster. Arnhen</hi> ſtands vpon the banke of <hi>Rhijne.</hi> This is the ſeat of the high Court of iuſtice, and of the Chancery. The Clergie of this towne are ſubiect to the Biſhop of <hi>Vtrecht.</hi> HATTEM a towne well fortified vpon the riuer <hi>Yſſel.</hi> ELBVRG on the ſhore of the Zuyder ſea. HARDERVVIIK, vpon the ſame ſhore. Heere likewiſe you haue WAGENING, TIEL, BOMMEL, BRONCHORST, DOESBVRG, DOTECHEM, SHEERENBERG, gouerned by a peculiar prince vnder the name of an Earledome; LOCHEN, GROLL, BREDEVORD, GELRE which perhaps gaue name to the whole region; STRAELEN, VENLO, a towne vpon the banke of <hi>Maeſe</hi> fortified both by arte and nature; WACHTENDVNCK, of ancient times the city of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> in the Dukedome of <hi>Iuliers.</hi> Beſides theſe there are other ſmall townes of note; which though now either by furie of warre, or iniurie of time, they are vnwalled; yet they doe enioy the freedomes and priuileges of cities. Their names be <hi>Keppel, Burg, Genderen, Bateburg, Monteford, Echt, Culeburg,</hi> and <hi>Buren;</hi> both which haue a peculiar Lord as <hi>Bateburg</hi> alſo. Vnder Earle <hi>Ottho</hi> the third, this region was mightily inlarged; for he compaſſed with walles, and endowed with priuileges the townes of <hi>Rure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Arnhem, Harderwijk, Bemel, Goch,</hi> and <hi>VVagening,</hi> which till that time had remained villages. In the Chronicle of <hi>Iohn Reigerſbeg</hi> written in Dutch, I finde this region in the time of <hi>Carolus Caluus</hi> to haue beene called by the name of <hi>Ponthis;</hi> and that it was by him in the yeere 878. erected to a Signiorie. Then in the yeere 1079. this Signiorie of <hi>Ponthis</hi> was by <hi>Henrie</hi> the third adorned with the title of an Earledome, and called the Earledome of <hi>Guelders:</hi> and the firſt Earle thereof was <hi>Otto à Naſſau.</hi> It went vnder the name of an Earledome till <hi>Reinhold</hi> the ſecond. But whenas this <hi>Reinhold</hi> not only for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and mightineſſe grew terrible to his neighbours, but renowmed in regard of his iuſtice, his piety and fidelity towards the Roman empire; he was at <hi>Frankford</hi> in a ſolemne and royal aſſembly by <hi>Lewes</hi> the Emperour conſecrated Duke; in preſence of the King of <hi>England,</hi> the French King, and the Princes Electours, in the yeere of our Lord 1339.</p>
            <p>Some ſay, that in the time of the Emperour <hi>Carolus Caluus,</hi> towards that place where the towne of <hi>Gelre</hi> now ſtandeth, there was a ſtrange and venimous beaſt, of huge bigneſſe and monſtrous crueltie, feared all the countrey ouer, which lay for the moſt part vnder an Oake. This monſter waſted the fields, deuoured cattell great and ſmall, and abſtained not from men. The inhabitants affrighted with the noueltie and vncouthneſſe of the matter, abandoned their habitations, and hid themſelues in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and ſolitarie places. A certaine Lord of <hi>Ponth</hi> had two ſonnes; who partly tendring their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and partly alſo the diſtreſſe of their neighbours, aſſailed the beaſt with ſingular policie and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and after a long combat ſlew him. The ſaid Lord therefore not farre from the Maeſe vpon the banke of <hi>Nierſon,</hi> for the perpetuall memorie of his ſonnes exploit, built a caſtle which he called <hi>Gelre;</hi> becauſe when the beaſt was ſlaine, he often yelled with a dreadfull roaring noiſe, <hi>Gelre, Gelre:</hi> from whence they ſay, began the name of the Guelders. Thus much out of the Chronicle of <hi>Henry Aquilius</hi> a Guelder borne.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common and conſtant opinion, that thoſe which we now call <hi>Leodien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or <hi>Ligeois</hi> are a German people named of old <hi>Eburones.</hi> A relique or monument of which ancient name remaineth as yet in the village <hi>Ebure,</hi> a German mile diſtant from the city of <hi>Liege.</hi> And this very place (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) is deſcribed by <hi>Dion lib. 40.</hi> vnder the name <hi>Eburonia.</hi> Howbeit certaine it is, that the iuriſdiction of <hi>Liege</hi> ſtretcheth much farther than that of the Eburones did of olde.

            </p>
            <p>This region taketh vp a great part of ancient <hi>Lorraigne:</hi> for it containes vnder the name of the dioceſſe of <hi>Liege,</hi> the dukedome of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the marqueſat of <hi>Franckmont,</hi> the countie of <hi>Haſpengow,</hi> and Loots, and many Baronies. In this region beſides <hi>Maeſtright,</hi> halfe wherof is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> there are foure and twentie walled cities, a thouſand ſeuen hundred Villages, with Churches and many Abbeys and Signiories. The names of the cities are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; <hi>Liege</hi> vpon <hi>Maeſe,</hi> the ſeat of a Biſhop, after which all the whole countrey is named: <hi>Bouillon Franchemont, Loots, Borchworm, Tungeren, Huy, Haſſelt, Dinant, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac, Stoch, Bilſen, S.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer <hi>Placentius</hi> writeth, that part of <hi>Maeſtright</hi> was added to this dioceſſe by the donation of <hi>Pori</hi> Earle of <hi>Louaine.</hi> The territorie of this citie is called the countie of <hi>Maeſland</hi> in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient records of <hi>Seruatius</hi> abbey, built here by King <hi>Arnulphus</hi> in the yeere <hi>889.</hi> Now this countie is vſually called <hi>Haſpengow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a region exceeding pleaſant and fertile of all things, eſpecially on the North part, where it ioyneth to <hi>Brabant;</hi> for there it aboundeth with corne and all kinde of fruits, and in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it yeeldeth wine. But on the South frontiers towards <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more barren, mountainous, and ouerſpred with woods; here yet being ſome remainder of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duenna</hi> the greateſt foreſt in all <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> writeth. This is the outward hiew of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but in the entrals and bowels thereof it is enriched with mettals and ſundry kinds of marbles; as alſo with ſea-coales, which they burne in ſtead of fewell; and all theſe ſo ſurpaſsing good, as in a common prouerbe they vſually ſay, that they haue <hi>bread better than bread, fire hotter than fire, and iron harder than iron.</hi> By their iron (than which all the prouinces around vſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better nor indeed any other) they raiſe a great reuenue. Nor with any other more forcible fire do the Smithes and Bearebrewers in all this part of the Low countries heat their furnaces than with theſe minerall coales of <hi>Liege;</hi> which are of ſo ſtrange a nature, as water increaſeth their flame, but oile puts it out. The ſmell of this fire or ſmoke, though it be ſomewhat loathſome to thoſe that are not accustomed with it, yet ſalt being cast thereupon, it ſmelleth either but a little, or not at all.

Howbeit, this part is not altogether fruitleſſe: for <hi>Iacobus Spie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legius</hi> writing to <hi>Guntherus</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> affirmeth that the husbandmen of <hi>Brabant</hi> are ſo induſtrious, as they make the drieſt ſandes to beare wheat. Alſo to head-cattell and ſheepe, the greateſt part whereof (as we reade in <hi>Homer</hi> of thoſe <hi>Libyan</hi> ſheepe) are horned; it yeelds moſt pleaſant and plentifull paſture. And now by the induſtry &amp; vnceſſant labour of the husbandmen it is dayly ſo manured; that where in times paſt there was nothing but vnprofitable ſand-heaps, you may at this preſent beholde, to the great benefit of the inhabitants, moſt fruitfull corne-fields. On the Eaſt part of this Prouince there is a kinde of bogge or quagmite called <hi>Peele,</hi> the ground whereof (as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth of the fields <hi>Gabienſis</hi> and <hi>Reatinus</hi>) trembleth vnder a mans foot; neither can it be paſſed by horſes or wagons, but only in Winter, when the vpper cruſt thereof is hardened with froſt.</p>
            <p>This region containes the Marqueſat of the ſacred Empire (the chiefe citie whereof is <hi>Antwerpe</hi>) as likewiſe the Marque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat of <hi>Bergis,</hi> the Dukedome of <hi>Arſchot,</hi> the Earledomes of <hi>Hochſtraten, Megen,</hi> and that of <hi>Cantecroy</hi> lately erected by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, &amp;c. It hath alſo woods and foreſts, abounding with wilde beaſts of ſundry kindes: the principall whereof are <hi>Grootenhout, Grootenheyst, Meerdael, Zauenterloo</hi> and <hi>Soenien</hi> the greateſt of all, conteining in it for the ſpace of ſeuen miles compaſſe ſundry villages &amp; monaſteries. Hunting and hawking (except in theſe fiue woods, which are reſerued for the Princes owne game) are free for all men. The people are ſo iocund, as they ſeeme ſcarſe to feele the inconueniences of olde age; which frolike diſpoſition of theirs hath giuen occaſion to their neighbours round about to vſe this ieſt: <hi>The longer the Brabanter liues, the more foole he.</hi> The aire is exceeding holſome: for when the plague hath beene moſt vehement in all the regions adiacent, <hi>Brabant</hi> hath often moſt wonderfully remained free.</p>
            <p>This Dukedome of <hi>Brabant</hi> hath ſix and twentie cities enuironed with walles and ditches. And they are theſe following: ANTVVERPE ſituate vpon <hi>Scheld,</hi> the moſt famous mart not only of <hi>Germanie,</hi> but of all <hi>Europe;</hi> and one of the ſtrongeſt cities in the world; being much beautified with the ſteeple of <hi>S. Maries</hi> built an incredible height of white marble. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace lately built, is ſcarſe to be matched in all <hi>Europe.</hi> BRVSSEL, abounding with ſweet fountaines. Here for the moſt part reſideth the Prince; and therefore is this towne ſo much frequented by Nobles and Courtiers. LOVAIN, a large city, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining Gardens, Vineyards, and Paſtures within the walles: well may you call it The habitation of the Muſes; for which purpoſe in the yeere 1426. <hi>Iohn</hi> the fourth Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> eſtabliſhed here an Vniuerſitie, which flouriſheth with all kind of learning. The territorie of this citie makes <hi>Brabant</hi> to glory of her vintage. Then followes MACHELEN, famous for the court of Parliament there inſtituted by Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundie</hi> in the yeere 1473. HERTOGENBOSCH, a towne of no ſmall importance, conteining an excellent Grammar ſchoole, and inhabited in times paſt with a moſt warlike people.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He region of <hi>Namur</hi> is at this preſent endowed with the title of an Earledome. Whether it was thus named of the principall citie, or that the city aſſumed this name from the region, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as yet vncertaine; as likewiſe the originall of the word it ſelfe. The inhabitants call it <hi>Namur,</hi> and the high Dutch <hi>Namen,</hi> but the true ſignification of the word they are vtterly ignorant of. For thoſe that affirme that an Idol called <hi>Nanus,</hi> was of old worſhipped, and deliuered anſwers and oracles vpon the ſame hill whereon now the caſtle of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi> is ſituate, and that afterward, when Chriſtian religion began to ſhine, this Idol waxing mute or ſilent, the whole region of <hi>Namure</hi> was ſo named of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus mutus;</hi> do (I thinke) report fables, without the authority of any approoued writers. <hi>Meierus</hi> affirmeth, that anciently it was called <hi>Neumur,</hi> as much to ſay in Latine as <hi>Nouus murus,</hi> a new wall.</p>
            <p>Vpon this region do border the prouinces of <hi>Liege, Brabant, Henault,</hi> and <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenburg.</hi> It is watered by <hi>Maeſe</hi> and <hi>Sambre,</hi> two nauigable riuers. The country is neither mountainous nor plaine; but raiſed here &amp; there into little hilles, and depreſſed into valleys: the woods, whereof the greateſt is called <hi>Marlaigne,</hi> yeeld plenty of game for Gentlemen. It abounds with things neceſſary for mans life. Here are many yron-mines. Here alſo they digge a kinde of ſtony or minerall coles, which in Dutch we call <hi>Steenkolen:</hi> the inhabitants, as likewiſe the Ligeois (for they are found with them alſo) terme them <hi>Hoille;</hi> the learned call them <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as much to ſay as <hi>Stone-coles.</hi> The nature of theſe ſtones is moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for whereas oyle increaſeth the flame of all other fewell, theſe burne more vehemently by caſting on water, and are quenched with oyle. With theſe coles the inhabitants and bordering nations (for they are tranſported hence into other countries) do make luſty fires: and Black-ſmithes do ſoften their yron bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with this, than with any other fiering. Here are quarries alſo, out of which are cut marbles of exceeding hardneſſe, both blacke, browne, and particoloured; wherewith the churches &amp; houſes of the regions adiacent are maruellouſly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. By meanes of which marbles the people of <hi>Namure</hi> reape no ſmall benefit.</p>
            <p>This county hath foure walled townes: <hi>Namure, Bouuignes, Charlemont,</hi> and <hi>

Here is the chiefe tribunall of iuſtice for the whole region. BOVVIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES ſtands vpon the Weſterne banke of <hi>Maeſe,</hi> a towne in times paſt glorious for building, and populous for inhabitants; but now ſo deformed and ruined with often warres, as it hath loſt the greateſt part of her beauty. CHARLEMONT is a moſt impregnable caſtle, ſo named and built by <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, neere the banke of <hi>Maeſe,</hi> on the top of an hill, by a village called <hi>Giuet.</hi> Neither is VALEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CVRE a towne of ſmall moment.

This region of old bare the title of a Marqueſate: but about the yere 1200. it was conuerted into an Earledome. The people are very warlike, and moſt loyall to their Prince. They ſpeake French. This region (as the reſt of the Lowe countries) is exactly deſcribed by <hi>Guicciardine.</hi>

                  <l>Of this place only challenge right.</l>
               </q> In length it conteineth about twenty, and in bredth ſixteene miles. In which ſpace (as <hi>Guicciardin</hi> reporteth) it comprehends foure and twenty townes, and aboue nine hundred and fiftie villages or hamlets. <hi>Robert Caenalis</hi> reckons vp in this Prouince two thouſand two hundred petie villages with Churches and ſteeples. At this preſent it beareth the title of an Earledome: and it containes within it one Princedome, eight inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Earledomes, twelue Peeres, two and twentie Baronies, ſix and twentie Abbeys, with other titles of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which are to be ſeene in <hi>Guicciardine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principall cities are <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Valenchienes:</hi> the laſt whereof ſituate vpon the riuer <hi>Scheld,</hi> where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be nauigable for boats and barks, is a towne very large and ſtrongly walled. The towneſmen for the moſt part imploy themſelues in trade of merchandiſe; and reape exceeding gaines by a kinde of cloth which they call <hi>Fuſſets,</hi> great quantitie whereof is wouen in this citie, and carried from hence to the furtheſt parts of the world. <hi>Mons</hi> ſtandeth vpon the little riuer <hi>Trouille,</hi> almoſt in the very midſt of all the region. A towne very ſufficiently fortified againſt all hoſtile attempts. The citizens enrich themſelues by a kinde of ſtuffe commonly called Saye, whereof great abundance is here made. Here are beſides the townes of <hi>Condet, Halle, Angie, Maubeuge, Aueſne, Beaumont, Chimay, Quercey,</hi> the retiring place of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſiſter to Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, who built there a moſt ſtately and ſumptuous Palace, which was then highly eſteemed; but afterward by the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond quite burned and defaced. Here alſo is <hi>Bauacum</hi> commonly called <hi>Bauais,</hi> which ſome thinke to be <hi>Baganum</hi> or <hi>Bagacum</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ptolemey.</hi> Others are of opinion, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his commentaries calles it <hi>Belgium.</hi> Howbeit <hi>Hubert</hi> of <hi>Liege</hi> thinks it not to haue been ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in <hi>Caeſars</hi> time, but rather moſt of all to haue flouriſhed vnder <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour: which he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth by the ancient coines here dayly digged vp in great quantitie, with the ſaid Emperours image vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. In the market-place of this towne ſtands a pillar of ſtone, at the foot whereof the inhabitants ſay that all thoſe wayes begin, which with an high and direct paſſage extend from hence to all parts of <hi>France.</hi> Theſe wayes (they ſay) were made by <hi>Brunchild.</hi> And euen till this day they are called after his name. For the French commonly term them <hi>Chemins de Brune hault;</hi> albeit the high Dutch call them <hi>de Raſije.</hi> There are as yet extant in ſundry places ſome broken remainders of theſe wayes. <hi>Bouillus</hi> noteth certaine wonders of them; namely, that they are higher than the fields on either ſide; that they lie moſt directly betweene the principall townes of <hi>France;</hi> and that they are paued with flint-ſtones, whereof all the fields adiacent are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute: ſo that with admiration a man may imagine, that theſe flints either ſprang out of the earth, or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downe from heauen, or by a greater force than mans hand were gathered all the world ouer for the grauelling of theſe wayes. Alſo vpon the frontiers of this region towards the riuer <hi>Maeſe,</hi> in the way to <hi>France,</hi> you haue <hi>Charlemont, Marieburg,</hi> and <hi>Philippeuille,</hi> moſt ſtrong garriſons againſt the incurſions of the French: being built and ſo named by Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, by <hi>Mary</hi> his ſiſter, and by K. <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonne.</p>
            <p>This region aboundeth with iron and lead-mines. Heere are found alſo ſundry kindes of marbles; as blacke, white, and particoloured; right commodious for the adorning of the palaces and ſepulchres of Kings and great Nobles. Likewiſe here is digged great plentie of lime. Alſo a kinde of ſtony and blacke coales, hardened in the nature of pitch, which the inhabitants vſe for fewell in ſtead of wood. And heere alſo are made thoſe thin tranſparent panes of glaſſe, by meanes whereof vnſeaſonable windes and weather are fenced out of houſes and churches; and this glaſſe excelleth all other that is made in any place beſides.

The head citie called in Latine <hi>Atrebatum,</hi> was of olde the Metropolitan alſo of <hi>Flanders;</hi> now it is named in French <hi>Arras,</hi> whereof the region adiacent and all the whole Prouince is called <hi>Artois,</hi> as if you would ſay <hi>Arratois,</hi> caſting away the middle ſyllable. Hereupon by a new Latine name they call it <hi>Arteſia.</hi> The whole region was by <hi>S. Lewis</hi> the French King adorned with the title of an Earledome: and the firſt Earle thereof was <hi>Robert</hi> the ſame Kings brother, as writeth <hi>Vignier.</hi> It is very large, extending from the frontiers of <hi>Cambreſis, Picardie, Henault,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> euen to the Ocean ſea. It was in times paſt ſubiect to the Crowne of <hi>France;</hi> but now by meanes of the peace betweene Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt the French King, concluded 1529, it is an abſolute ſtate of it ſelfe. It hath two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cities, namely, <hi>Arras</hi> and <hi>S. Omer:</hi> the principall townes be <hi>Ayre, Heſdin, Lens, Bethune, Bappames, S. Paul, Lillers,</hi> and <hi>Perne;</hi> all which places are ſubiect to the King Catholike. The cities of <hi>Boulogne, Calais, Guiſnes,</hi> and <hi>Ardres</hi> (which are alſo within the bounds of this Countie) are the French Kings: for <hi>Pontieu</hi> is now aboliſhed. It hath alſo diuers fortreſſes and ſtrong holds, beſides an incredible number of noblemens caſtles, which they vſe for dwelling houſes. It contained of olde two famous biſhopricks, namely <hi>Arras</hi> and <hi>Ponthieu:</hi> but ſince, <hi>Ponthieu</hi> in the yere 1553. was vtterly deſtroyed, the iuriſdiction thereof was diſtributed to three Epiſcopall ſeas; namely, <hi>S. Omer,</hi> and <hi>Ypre</hi> for the one halfe, and <hi>Boulogne</hi> for the reſidue. Bailiwicks or Hundreds, being the principall members or parts of the whole Countie, it hath nine; namely, that of <hi>Arras,</hi> of <hi>S. Omer,</hi> of <hi>Ponthieu,</hi> of <hi>Ayre, Heſdin, Lens, Bappames, Auen, Bredenard,</hi> and <hi>Aubignie.</hi> Vnder the Baili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke of <hi>Arras</hi> are comprized <hi>Boulogne, S.

Paul,</hi> of <hi>Arcques,</hi> of <hi>Blangie,</hi> of <hi>Faukenberge,</hi> and of <hi>Syneghen.</hi> Now alſo it is augmented with the Princedome of <hi>Eſpinee,</hi> and the Marqueſate of <hi>Renty.</hi> But how <hi>Boulogne</hi> firſt exempted it ſelfe from the iuriſdiction of <hi>Artois,</hi> it is manifeſt out of hiſtories: for after a certaine Earle of <hi>Boulogne</hi> was attainted of treaſon againſt the French King, the King vpon that occaſion ſeizing vpon his Earldom, it euer ſince denied homage vnto <hi>Artois.</hi> Wherefore the Earle of <hi>Artois</hi> loſing the one halfe of his right, aſſumed directly to himſelfe homage or fealty ouer the county of <hi>S. Paul</hi> (which before was feudatarie to the Earle of <hi>Boulogne</hi>) ſaying often times, that he would not be depriued both of his homage and vnder-homage: ſo that hitherto the Princes on both ſides haue vſed this cuſtom; namely, that <hi>Boulogne</hi> no more acknowledgeth <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois,</hi> nor <hi>S. Paul Boulogne.</hi> Howbeit about this point in the latter treaty of peace 1559. there was ſome variance; wherefore the matter being referred to Commiſsioners, remaines as yet vndecided, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill poſſeſsion. It is commonly ſuppoſed, that <hi>Calais</hi> (the next port of the continent vnto <hi>England</hi>) was by <hi>Caeſar</hi> called <hi>Portus Iccius,</hi> from whence he ſailed out of <hi>France</hi> thither. But if we more thorowly conſider the matter, we ſhall finde it to haue beene another Port, namely, the towne of <hi>Saint Omer,</hi> which that it was of old an hauen and a moſt large inlet of the Ocean ſea, euen the high cliffes, which in a maner enuironing the citie, do plainly demonſtrate, beſides infinit other arguments and reliques of antiquitie, which (though no man ſhould affirme it) do moſt euidently conuince, that the territorie adiacent was in times paſt coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſea; the trueth whereof is till this day alſo confirmed by common and conſtant report. Yea <hi>Sithieu</hi> the ancient name of the citie (for who knowes not that the name of <hi>S. Omer</hi> is but new) manifeſteth the ſame. As if it were deriued of <hi>Sinus Itthius</hi> or <hi>Iccius.</hi> Alſo that the ſaid haue was in the prouince of the <hi>Morini,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Lucan</hi> doe call the fartheſt people. And that this is moſt true, an attentiue Reader may by many arguments eaſily gather both out of <hi>Caeſar</hi> his entrance and returne from <hi>England.</hi> Neither can the ſpace of thirtie miles or thereabout, which he ſayth the iſland is there diſtant from the maine, hinder my beliefe in this point; whenas the violence of the ſea (eſpecially in ſo narrow a place) may eaſily either adde or diminiſh. Nor doth the diſtance of the ſea there from the maine to the continent much differ. Sufficeth thus much to haue beene ſaid concerning <hi>Portus Iccius.</hi> Whether we haue hit the trueth or no, let others iudge. Moreouer, this Prouince hath three Biſhopricks, to wit, <hi>Arras, S. Omer,</hi> and <hi>Boulogne;</hi> one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Abbeys, and ſeuen Nunries; beſides many Couents and Hoſpitals. It hath many riuers alſo; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall whereof are <hi>Lys, Scarpe, Aa, Canche,</hi> and <hi>Authy,</hi> beſides others that are nauigable.</p>
            <p>Great is the number of villages and hamlets thorowout the whole prouince. The ſoile is moſt fertile and abundant of all corne, and eſpecially of wheat. Wherefore in the ancient French tongue ſome write it was called <hi>Atrech,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>The land of bread.</hi> Nor is it deſtitute of woods and groues, eſpecially towards the South and Weſt. The garments of the Atrebates or Arteſians <hi>S. Ierome</hi> in his ſecond booke againſt <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinian</hi> noteth for precious. Alſo the Arteſian mantles <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> celebrateth in the life of the Emperour <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Likewiſe the ſame <hi>Ierome</hi> and other authours affirme, that in his time it rained wooll in this prouince.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He extreme part of <hi>Europe,</hi> oppoſite to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> enuironed by <hi>France, Germanie,</hi> and the Ocean, is called by the inhabitants, The low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or lower <hi>Germanie:</hi> but the French and all ſtrangers in a maner call it by the name of <hi>Flanders.</hi> But in very deed <hi>Flanders</hi> hath not ſo great extenſion. For albeit <hi>Flanders</hi> properly ſo called was larger in times past; yet at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it is bounded by <hi>Brabant, Henault, Artois,</hi> and the Ocean ſea. This they diuide into three parts, namely, <hi>Flanders</hi> the Dutch, the French, and the Imperiall; which laſt part (becauſe it neuer acknowledged any ſuperior, beſides the Prince of <hi>Flanders</hi>) they name alſo <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> proprietarie. The Dutch <hi>Flanders</hi> hath theſe cities; <hi>Gant, Bruges, Yperen, Cortrijck, Oudenard</hi> with <hi>Pammele, Newport, Furnas, Bergen, Sluiſe, Damme, Bierflet, Dixmud, Caſſel, Dunkerke, Greueling, Burburch,</hi> and <hi>Hulſt.</hi> The French <hi>Flanders, L'iſle, Doway,</hi> and <hi>Orchies.</hi> And <hi>Flanders</hi> Imperiall or Proprietary, <hi>Aelſt, Dendermond, Geertsberg,</hi> and <hi>Ninouen.</hi> The principall riuers are <hi>Scheld, Lys,</hi> and <hi>Dender.</hi> Moſt part of the region is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture-ground, eſpecially towards the West: it breedeth faire oxen, and moſt excellent and warlike horſes. It abounds with butter and cheeſe; and yeeldeth wheat in abundance. The inhabitants are most of them merchants: and of flax (wherof they haue in <hi>Flanders</hi> great plenty, &amp; excellent good) and wooll (which is brought them out of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>England</hi>) they make great quantity of linnen and woollen cloth, which they diſperſe farre and wide. This Prouince of <hi>Flanders</hi> hath <hi>28.</hi> walled cities, <hi>1154</hi> villages, beſides fortreſſes, castles, and noble mens houſes. Among which <hi>Gaunt</hi> is the greatest citie. Whereof <hi>Eraſmus</hi> of <hi>Roterdam</hi> in his Epistles writeth in maner following: I am of opinion (ſaith he) if you looke all Christendome ouer, you ſhall not finde a citie comparable to this, either for largeneſſe and ſtrength, or for the ciuill gouernment and towardlineſſe of the people. So far <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> It containeth in compaſſe three Dutch miles. It is watered by three riuers, which diuide it into twenty inhabited iſles. For multitude and beauty of houſes <hi>Bruges</hi> excelleth almost all the cities of the Netherlands; ſo famous a mart in times past, as (ſaith <hi>Iacobus Marchantius</hi>) by that meanes the name of <hi>Flanders</hi> obſcured all the regions round about. <hi>Yperen</hi> ſtands vpon the riuer of <hi>Yperlee,</hi> very commodious for Fullers. By clothing it grew in times paſt to an huge big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, till the Engliſh and men of <hi>Gaunt</hi> beſieging it, caſt downe the large ſuburbs, and greatly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſame.</p>
            <p>As it is ſayd in a common prouerbe, that <hi>Millan</hi> for a Dukedome excelles all Christendome; ſo doth <hi>Flanders</hi> for an Earledome. It hath certaine prerogatiues: for the Prince thereof writes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> by the grace of God: which clauſe is proper to the ſtile of Kings. For it is giuen <hi>(ſaith Meierus)</hi> to no Duke, Marques, or Earle in Chriſtendome, but only to him of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> whenas all others vſually adde, <hi>By the clemency,</hi> or <hi>By the aſsiſtance of God,</hi> &amp;c. He had in times paſt ſundry officers peculiar to a King; as namely his Chancellour, his Maſter of the horſe, his Chamberlain, and his Cupbearer; alſo two Marſhals and ten Peeres, as in <hi>France.</hi> The armes of this region in times past were a ſcutcheon Azure, diuided by fiue Croſſe-barres of golde with another ſmall red ſcutcheon in the midst. Now it is a blacke lion in a golden field; which ſome are of opinion, he tooke for his armes, together with the other Netherlandiſh Princes, when they ſet forth on their expedition towards <hi>Syria</hi> in the company of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Elſas:</hi> for at that time the princes of <hi>Flanders, Louaine, Holland, Lutzenburg, Limburg, Brabant, Zeland, Friſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Henault,</hi> &amp;c. changing their ancient armes, aſſumed to themſelues lions of diuers colours.</p>
            <p>The greater part of <hi>Flanders</hi> was from the beginning vnder protection of the French Kings; but now it is at libertie, and abſolute of it ſelfe; being releaſed by Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, Earle of <hi>Flanders:</hi> who in the treatie of <hi>Madrid</hi> quite ſhooke off the French yoke. This region <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardine</hi> hath most diligently deſcribed, and <hi>Iacobus Marchantius</hi> moſt learnedly.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Euinus Lemnius</hi> of <hi>Zirichzee,</hi> in his booke <hi>De occultis naturae miraculis,</hi> Of the bidden ſecrets of Nature, amongſt other things writeth thus of <hi>Zeland,</hi> his natiue country: That this Marine tract, ſaith he, was notvnknowne vnto the ancients, it may out of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> eaſily be gathered; although not by the ſame name, that at this day it is knowne by: but of a cuſtome and common kind of ſalutation and ſpeaking one to another, which acquaintance and friends of this prouince do vſe at their meetings: therefore he calleth them by the name of <hi>MATTIACI,</hi> when he thus writeth: <hi>In the ſame iuriſdiction are the</hi> Mattiaci, <hi>a nation very like the</hi> Bataui, <hi>but that thoſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſituation of their countrie, are more deſperate and couragious.</hi> Whereby he giueth to vnderſtand, that although they are next neighbours and do border vpon the <hi>Bataui</hi> or Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, (ſo called of the hollowneſſe and lowneſſe of the ground) ſo that they might iuſtly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one and the ſame people, yet are only diſtinguiſhed by the name of their cuſtomary ſaluation; and being neerer the Sea, are more hardie and audacious; (as indeed they are,) and for manhood, witte, policy, craft, deceits, cunning in buying and ſelling, and diligence in getting, and waies to enrich themſelues, they do farre excell them. And in that hee calleth them <hi>Mattiaci,</hi> I conceiue it, that they were not ſo named either of any place or captaine, but of that fellowlike ſalutation, as I ſaid, and vſuall maner of ſpeaking one to another vſuall amongſt them, to witte, of <hi>Maet,</hi> which in common ſpeach and friendly meetings, ſignifieth a fellow and companion in all our actions, bargaines, contracts, and dangers; of all our purpoſes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes, labours and trauailles: a copartner and conſort in any thing whatſoeuer we take in hand or go about, &amp;c. For the name of <hi>Zeland</hi> is not ancient, but is lately inuented, and made of Sea and Land, as who would ſay <hi>Sea-land,</hi> a country or land bordering vpon the ſea: for it is encloſed round with the ocean, conſiſting of fifteene Ilands, although it be not long ſince the raging Sea did great hurt in this country, by whoſe violence and ouerflowing, a good part of <hi>Zeland,</hi> (his dammes, walles and banks being rent and broken downe,) was ouercome of the ſalt-water and laid leuell with the ſea: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding certaine of them do remaine, of which eſpecially three do continually wreſtle with the boiſterous billowes of the ſea, and do very hardly defend themſelues with infinite coſts and charges againſt this rude and vnruly element. Of theſe firſt <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheren (Walachria)</hi> doth offer it ſelfe to the eie of ſuch as do ſaile to theſe coaſts; ſo named either of him that firſt entered and inhabited in it, or (as I geſſe) of the Gaulls <hi>(Galli)</hi> which much frequented this country; who of the Low-countrie-men are yet called <hi>Walen;</hi> or of that part of <hi>Brittaine</hi> which lieth vpon the Weſt ſide of it, and is called <hi>Wales,</hi> the moſt gentleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and braueſt nation (you may beleeue him,) amongſt the Engliſh, and deſcended alſo from the Gaulles, which their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as yet doth manifeſt &amp;c. From hence Northward or ſomewhat declining toward the Eaſt is <hi>Scouwen <hi>Scaldia,</hi>
               </hi> the Latines call it of the riuer <hi>Sceldt,</hi> which runneth by it and heere falleth into the ſea &amp;c. <hi>Suytheuelandt,</hi> ſo named of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it toward the South (to diſtinguiſh it from another diſtant from it Northward and therefore called <hi>Noortheuelandt</hi>) a large and moſt goodly tract of ground, coaſting along the ſhore of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> although of late yeares hauing ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered great dammage and loſſe, it is now much leſſe and narrower. Thus farre <hi>Lemnius. Tritthemius</hi> in the Annalles of the Franks nameth <hi>Middleborough</hi> the chiefe city of theſe Ilands <hi>Meſoburgus Meyer;</hi> calleth it <hi>Mattiacum,</hi> more like a Latiniſt, then a true Geographer. More of theſe thou maiſt read in the forenamed <hi>Lemnius,</hi> who hath moſt excellently well deſcribed all the Ilands of <hi>Zeland,</hi> and the cities of the ſame. To theſe if thou wilt, thou maiſt adioine <hi>Lewis Guicciardine,</hi> and I know not what els thou canſt ſeeke for further ſatisfaction. There are alſo certaine Annalles of theſe Ilands, written in the mother tongue by <hi>Iohn Reygersberg.</hi> But for an incomme, thou maiſt alſo to theſe former adde the deſcriptions of the cities of the Low-countries, done by <hi>Adrian Barland.</hi> Of the people of this prouince theſe verſes are commonly ſpoken:

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus <hi>Eraſmus</hi> of <hi>Roterodam,</hi> an Hollander doth deſcribe <hi>Holland,</hi> his natiue country: Moſt learned men, ſaith he, do agree in this, and that vpon great probabil ty, that that iland of the Rhein vpon the maine ſea, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> maketh mention of in his 20. booke, is the ſame that now they call HOLLAND. A land that I muſt alwaies both highly commend &amp; reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as to whom indeed I owe my life and natiuitie: And I would to God that it lay in my power to do it againe as great credit, as it hath done me honour and good, for the which I am much bound to praiſe the Lord. For in that that Martiall doth accuſe this nation <hi>ruſticitatis,</hi> of clowniſh ſimplicity; and that in that <hi>Lucane</hi> calleth the ſame <hi>trucem,</hi> rough and vnciuill, either it is nothing to vs, or els I deeme both to be interpreted as a great commendation vnto the ſame. For what nation in former times hath not been ſomewhat rude and vnciuill? or when were the Romanes more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, then when they knew no other art or myſterie but husbandrie and diſcipline of warre? If ſo be that thoſe things which then were ſaid of the Hollanders, ſome man ſhall ſtand in they may be verified of them now; what greater praiſe can be attributed to <hi>Holland,</hi> my natiue country, then if it may truly be ſaid to loath thoſe ieſts of <hi>Martiall,</hi> which he himſelfe calleth <hi>nequitias,</hi> knaueries? And I would to God that all Chriſtians had ſuch eares, as theſe Hollanders had, that they might either not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoſe peſtilent conceits of that Poet, or at the leaſtwiſe would not be delighted with them. If any man pleaſe to call this clowniſhneſſe, we do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly beare that ſlanderous reproch, as being a thing common to vs with the good Lacedemonians, with the old Sabines &amp; the worthy Catoes, ſo much commended. And <hi>Lucane,</hi> as I thinke, called the Hollanders <hi>truces,</hi> rough, in no other ſenſe then <hi>Virgill</hi> calleth the Romane <hi>acer,</hi> ſtout and hardie. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if any man do reſpect their homely and plaine maners, there is no nation more prone to ciuility and curteous humanity, in which there is leſſe cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſurly ſternneſſe; they are of a good nature, plaine, void of all trechery and guile, inclined to no notorious vices: only they are a little too much giuen to their pleaſure, eſpecially in banquetting: the reaſon of which I iudge to be the wonderfull plenty of all maner of things prouoking them thereunto: and that partly by reaſon of the forrein commodities brought vnto them, for that not only it poſſeſſeth the two mouths of the goodly riuers <hi>Maeſe</hi> and <hi>Rhein,</hi> but alſo for that the greateſt part of this Weſt coaſt is continually waſhed with the maine ſea: partly by reaſon of the naturall fertility of the countrie, which euery where is watered with many great and nauigable riuers well ſtored with fiſh, and ſo hath abundance of paſtorage and moſt fatte meadowes. Moreouer the fennes and woods affoord infinite ſtore of wild-foule: and therefore they conſtantly affirme that there is no country in the world, which in ſo little compaſſe and plot of ground conteineth more cities and townes, not very big in quantity and circuite, but for ſtate of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and gouernment excellent. For cleanlineſſe and near keeping of their houſes, the Hollanders do beare away the bell from all other nations whatſoeuer, by the iudgement of Merchants which haue trauelled ouer the greateſt part of the world. Of meane learned men there is no where greater plenty. The reaſon why many of them come not to the height of that exquiſite learning, eſpecially of the ancients, is their wanton and riotous life, or for that they eſteeme more of honeſty and vertue, then great learning: For it cannot be denied but that they haue good wits, as is manifeſt by many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: although indeed it doth not appeare by me, whoſe gift that way is not great, as in nothing els. Thus farre <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his <hi>Chiliades.</hi>

            <p>This country of <hi>Holland</hi> almoſt wholly encloſed like a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> with the ſea, and the mouths of the riuers <hi>Maes</hi> and <hi>Rhein,</hi> is not very large, as being in compaſſe not more then 60. Dutch miles: yet it comprehendeth 29. walled cities, which are theſe, DORDRECHT, about an hundred yeares ſince by a deluge and ouerflowing of the ſea made an iland: by this 4. riuers do runne. It is a mightie city, inhabited of very wealthy citizens, and beautified with moſt gallant buildings both publike and priuate. Heere is a great concourſe of Merchants: for in it is held the ſtaple of Rheniſh wine, corne, timber, and other wares and merchandice which are brought downe by the <hi>Maes</hi> and <hi>Rhein</hi> into theſe countries to be ſold. HAERLEM; this is the moſt ſtately and greateſt citie of all <hi>Holland,</hi> ſituate in a moſt pleaſant place. Hard without the town walls is a very fine groue, whither the citizens vpon feſtiuall daies, do withdraw themſelues, for their pleaſure and recreation, after their labour and toileſome buſines. This town is famous for clothing, where it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that there are tenne or twelue thouſand clothes yearely made. Heere the citizens do perſwade themſelues the myſterie of printing was firſt inuented and practiſed. DELET, ſo named of <hi>Delft,</hi> which in their language ſignifieth a ditch. Heere alſo the towneſmen vſe clothing. Moreouer in this city, they brue good beere, which from hence in great plenty is tranſported into <hi>Zeland.</hi> This towne in the yeare 1536. ſuffered great loſſe by fire, the greateſt part of it being vtterly defaced. LEIDEN, vpon the <hi>Rhein,</hi> not far from his mouth where it ſometime did fall into the ſea, which now you may perceiue to be ſtopped &amp; choaked with ſand. It is thought to be the moſt ancient city of this prouince: for ſome do thinke it to haue beene ſo named of a Roman legion which ſometime wintered in this place. Certaine antiquities are heere yet to be ſeene to this day. GOVDE vpon the riuer <hi>Iſel,</hi> in that place where it meeteth with the riuer <hi>Goude</hi> or <hi>Gouwe,</hi> whereof the city tooke his name. It is very populous. AMSTELREDAM, moſt ſtately built vpon the inlet or bay called <hi>Tie,</hi> the moſt populous and frequent Mart towne of all theſe parts. In euery ſtreet almoſt, like as in <hi>Venice,</hi> a man may paſſe from place to place, by boate aſwell as by foot, to diſpatch his buſineſſe. Heere daily from <hi>Norway, kuſſia,</hi> and other Northren countries, as alſo from <hi>Spaine, France, England,</hi> &amp;c. great ſtore of ſhippes do arriue and ancher; ſo that ſometimes you ſhall ſee at once two hundred or three hundred faile of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſhippes (<hi>hulks</hi> they call them) to ride heereat anchor. Therefore this city for traffique, is commonly held to yeeld to none but <hi>Antwerp.</hi> EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CKHVISEN, vpon that ſea, which they vulgarly call in their language <hi>Suyderzee.</hi> Famous euen in forren countries for the building of great ſhippes. HOORN, ſituate alſo vpon the ſame bay. Heere in May is kept a faire, where there is ſold ſuch infinite ſtore of butter and cheeſe, as is wonderfull. ALKMAER; this place for plenty of butter and cheeſe doth excell all other cities of this prouince. PVRMERENDE, famous for the caſtle or palace of the Count <hi>Egmond.</hi> EDAM, for building of ſhippes and good cheeſe, deſerueth alſo to be remembred amongſt the reſt. Moreouer MVNNEKENDAM, WEESP, NAERDEN, and WEERT may not be forgotten. OVDEVVATER, heere groweth great ſtore of hemp, ſo that heere they make almoſt all the nets, ropes and cables which the Hollanders and Zelanders do vſe in fiſhing. SCOONHOVEN; as who would ſay, At the faire Orchards. Here is continuall fiſhing for Salmons, where alſo is held a Staple of this commodity, as we ſaid there was of wine at <hi>Dordrecht.</hi> Next after theſe do follow I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELSTEIN, VIANEN: Item LEERDAM, ASPEREN, and HVEKELEN, three little cities round in a circle vpon the riuer <hi>Lingen,</hi> not about 500. paſes one from another. GORICVM and WORICHVM, ſituate, vpon the banke of the riuer <hi>Wael,</hi> one ouer againſt another. <hi>Gorichum</hi> hath a very goodly and beautifull caſtle. A man may iuſtly call this town a city of ſtore of all maner prouiſion: ſuch a market is heere daily kept of ſuch things as are neceſſary for the ſuſtenance of mans life, which are from thence tranſported by ſhippe vnto other countries, but eſpecially to <hi>Antwerp:</hi> Laſtly, there are HVESDEN, ROTERODAM, SCHIEDAM, and both the MOVNTS, the one known by the name of <hi>S. Gertrude,</hi> the other of the number of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; <hi>Seuenbergen</hi> I meane, and <hi>Geertruydenberge,</hi> for ſo they call them. Other towns there are, which ſometime were walled: which although at this day we do now ſee them to want, either by the rage of violent warre, or by reaſon of other misfortunes, yet they ſtill enioy their old liberties and fredoms. Of this ſort <hi>Medenblick Beuerwijck, Muiden, Neuport, Vlaerdingen,</hi> and <hi>Graueſande.</hi> Moreouer in this prouince there are aboue foure hundred villages, amongſt the which the <hi>Haghe,</hi> (which they call <hi>Earls Haghe</hi>) doth farre excell the reſt. This town <hi>Guicciardine</hi> thinketh for bigneſſe, wealth, beauty and pleaſant ſituation to ſurpaſſe all other in <hi>Europe</hi> whatſoeuer: for it conteineth two thowſand houſes: of which the Princes pallace, built like a caſtell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with a wall and dich, where the Priuy courts of Iuſtice are held, is one. Neere vnto is a darke or thicke grone, which by reaſon of the ſinging of birds, and ſight of Deere, is both to the eares and eies moſt pleaſant and delightfull. I might more iuſtly call it <hi>Comopolis,</hi> a citie like town; and may boldly compare it with <hi>Cteſiphon</hi> a borough in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> ſituate vpon the riuer <hi>Tigris,</hi> much magnified of all ancient writers: of which <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, that that town is equall to a city for command and bigneſſe, and was the place where the Parthian kings did vſe to winter, when they were deſirous to ſpare the city of <hi>Seleucia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vnder the Iuriſdiction alſo of <hi>Holland</hi> are certaine Ilands, as <hi>Voorn,</hi> (with the towns <hi>Geervliet,</hi> and <hi>Briele,) Goereden,</hi> or <hi>Goere,</hi> (with a town of the ſame name: <hi>Somerſdijcke, Tenel,</hi> &amp; diuers others. The dioceſſe of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> gouerned not long ſince by a Biſhop, in which were 5. cities, yeelded it ſelfe to be ſubiect to the iuriſdiction of <hi>Holland,</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> This country is ſo encloſed with the ſea, ſeuered by riuers, lakes, creeks and ditches, whereby it is diuided as it were into certaine plots and quarters, that there is no city nor village heere, to which one may not go aſwell by water as by waggon. Neither is there any place in the whole prouince, from whence one may not eaſily in three houres ſpace, go to the ſea. <hi>Chryſoſtomus Neapolitanus</hi> hath deſcribed this <hi>Olland,</hi> (for ſo he writeth it) in an eloquent letter of his directed to <hi>Counte Nugarolo.</hi> Of this read the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Holland,</hi> compiled by <hi>Gerardus Geldenhaurius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Aurelius,</hi> as alſo <hi>Peter Diuey,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Hadrianus Iunius</hi> his <hi>Batauia.</hi> Of the wonderfull ſtore and abundance of this country, read <hi>Lud.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the <hi>Frisij,</hi> a moſt ancient nation, did long ſince inhabit along the ſea coaſt, neere the mouth of the riuer of <hi>Rhein,</hi> where alſo at this day they dwell, it is very apparant out of the records of ancient writers. For <hi>Ptolemey</hi> placeth them aboue the <hi>Buſactores</hi> (or <hi>Buſacteri,</hi> the people of that prouince which now is called <hi>Weſtfalia,</hi> as ſome thinke) between the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <hi>Vidrus,</hi> (they call it <hi>Regge</hi>) and <hi>Amaſius,</hi> now called <hi>Eems. Tacitus,</hi> who reporteth that they were of good account amongſt the Germanes, and along by the ſea coaſt to dwell on ech ſide the <hi>Rhein:</hi> diuideth them according to their power and greatnes of command, into <hi>Maiores</hi> and <hi>Minores,</hi> the Greater and the Leſſer: hee moreouer affirmeth that they dwell round about certaine huge Lakes, ſuch as were capable of the Roman fleet. The ſame authour nameth certaine <hi>Friſios Tranſrhenanos,</hi> Frieſlandmen, dwelling beyond the <hi>Rhein:</hi> which he ſaith did rather miſlike the auarice of the Romanes then their command. <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> in the life of <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Albinus</hi> the Emperour, ſaith, that theſe Tranſrhenane Frieſlanders were by the ſame <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi> diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ouerthrowne. <hi>Pliny</hi> mentioneth certaine Ilands of the Frieſlanders <hi>(inſulas Friſiorum)</hi> in the riuer of <hi>Rhein:</hi> and the <hi>Eriſciabones,</hi> a kind of people between <hi>Helium</hi> and <hi>Fleuum,</hi> two mouthes of the <hi>Rhein,</hi> where it emptieth it ſelfe into the maine ſea.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt therefore that the <hi>Frisij,</hi> anciently did not paſſe the riuer <hi>Eems:</hi> but at this day they are further ſpred Eaſtward, almoſt as farre as the riuer <hi>Weſer,</hi> (the old Geographers called it <hi>Viſurgis.</hi>) Who alſo otherwiſe of them ſometime, were deſigned by the name of the <hi>Chauci;</hi> (or <hi>Cauchi,</hi> for diuers authours write it diuerſly) it is out of all doubt. And beſide theſe vp higher, euen in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> in the confines of the little prouince <hi>Dietmarſh,</hi> there dwell a people vulgarly knowne by the name of <hi>Strandt Vrieſen,</hi> that is, Frieſlandmen inhabiting vpon the ſea coaſt. Theſe it may be were thoſe which <hi>Ptolemey</hi> calleth <hi>Sigulones. Saxo Grammaticus,</hi> and <hi>Albertus Crantzius,</hi> calleth this <hi>Friſiam Eydorenſem,</hi> (of the riuer <hi>Eider</hi> vpon which it bordereth) and <hi>Friſiam Minorem,</hi> the Leſſer <hi>Frieſland,</hi> both of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a branch ſprung from thoſe ancient <hi>Frisij. Cornelius Kempius</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> diuideth the whole country into ſeuen <hi>Zelands,</hi> that is, marine ſhires, you may terme them. The firſt is vpon the Weſt of the riuer <hi>Fleuus</hi> or <hi>Iſel,</hi> and now is called <hi>Waterlandt:</hi> Then <hi>Weſtergoe,</hi> as who would ſay, The Weſt-land: The third <hi>Oeſtergoe,</hi> that is, The Eaſt-land. Theſe three he ſaith are commonly known and conteined vnder the name of WEST FRIESLAND. The fourth is about the riuer <hi>Iſel,</hi> where the cities <hi>Dauenter, Swool, Haſſelt, Steenwijck</hi> and <hi>Wollenhoue</hi> are ſeated. The fifth conteineth the liberties of <hi>Groeningen:</hi> The ſixt that part which they call Eaſt-<hi>Frieſland.</hi> The ſeuenth is from the riuer <hi>Weſer,</hi> beyond <hi>Elbe,</hi> euen vnto the little riuer <hi>Eyder.</hi> Otherwiſe this country of the <hi>Frisij,</hi> is vulgarly diuided into three parts, Eaſt <hi>Frieſland,</hi> Weſt <hi>Frieſland,</hi> and Middle <hi>Frieſland,</hi> which of ſome is called <hi>Groningen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ptolemey</hi> nameth three towns of the <hi>Frisij, Manarmanis, Phleum,</hi> and <hi>Siatutanda: Fleum Caſtellum</hi> in <hi>Tacitus</hi> is the ſame as I thinke that <hi>Phleum</hi> is in <hi>Ptolemey:</hi> the ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> alſo maketh mention of <hi>Cruptoricis ſtipendarij villa</hi> the Mannor of <hi>Cruptorix</hi> the ſtipendary: Item, the groue of <hi>Baduhenna,</hi> where he greatly lamenteth that 900. Romans had their throats cut, and where another ſupplie of 400. men, after that they had a ſuſpicion of treaſon, did one kill another. The ſame authour writeth that in his time <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars were heere ſtill remaining. <hi>The braue couragious minde of this nation and high conceit of their owne valour, is manifeſt by the hiſtory of</hi> Verritus <hi>and</hi> Malorix, <hi>two of their princes. For theſe (as</hi> Tacitus <hi>reporteth) going to</hi> Rome, <hi>and finding</hi> Nero <hi>the Emperour buſied about other matters, amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which were vſually ſhewed to barbarous people, they came into</hi> Pompeys <hi>theatre, that they might behold the greatneſſe of it. While they ſate idly there vpon the ſcaffolds (for they were not caried away altogether with the ſight of the paſtimes, as if they neuer had ſeen ſuch before) they question about the differences of eſtates, what or who was a knight, and where ſate the Senatours, they obſerued ſome to ſit in the Senatours rooms in a ſtrange habit: and demanding who they were, after they heard, that that honour was giuen to the Embaſſadours of thoſe nations which for valour, and amity with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans did excell others, they cried out with a loud voice,</hi> THERE ARE NO PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, THAT FOR PROVVES AND FIDELITY DO GO BEFORE THE GERMANES: <hi>and thereupon they left their places &amp; placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the Senatours roome: and it was well taken of the beholders, as a token of their ancient ſpirit and earneſt emulation of vertue.</hi> Nero <hi>made them both freemen of the city of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth in the third chapter of the fifth booke of his naturall hiſtorie, that amongſt the Frieſlanders there grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an hearb which they call <hi>Britannica,</hi> hauing long blacke leaues; and a blacke roote. The iuice of this herb is preſſed alſo out of the roote. The flowres by a proper name they call <hi>Vibones:</hi> which being gathered before any thunder is heard, and eaten, do wholly preſerue a man from that danger. This herb is not only good and medicinable for the ſinews, and diſeaſes of the mouth, but alſo againſt the Golne or Squinancy and biting of Serpents. Whether this herb be at this day certainly knowne, and by what name, I deſire to be informed of our learned Herbatiſts.</p>
            <p>Whether that the inhabitants of this prouince be thoſe ſame <hi>Frisij,</hi> or whether happily they tooke their beginning and name from the Phrygians of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as ſome would haue it, or from others of other places, (for <hi>Strabo</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth alſo certaine <hi>Phrygi</hi> in <hi>Illyria,</hi> about the <hi>Ceraunian</hi> hilles) I leaue to the learned to determine. The idle fables of thoſe men I cannot choſe but laugh at, which do thinke that theſe <hi>Frisij</hi> came into this country from <hi>Freſia,</hi> a prouince of <hi>India.</hi> If I were delighted with fables, I had rather with <hi>Hanibald</hi> fetch the name of this people from their king <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Clodio.</hi> The writers of middle age, eſpecially the French, do call them, as I haue obſerued, <hi>Friſones,</hi> by a name framed of the French word <hi>Friſons,</hi> by which the Frenchmen at this day vulgarly do call the people of this prouince. They retaine euen to this day the ancient name. For they are commonly, amongſt themſelues in their own language, called <hi>Frieſen,</hi> by which name alſo they are known throughout all <hi>Germanie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were conuerted vnto Chriſtianitie by S. <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> at that ſame time when <hi>Zacharie</hi> was Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> There is a ſtrange hiſtorie of <hi>Rabod</hi> Duke of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> who when he ſhould by Baptiſme haue beene conſecrated and adopted into the number of Chriſts flocke, he demanded to what place his Grandfathers and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandfathers were gone before him: and when he vnderſtood that they were all gone to Hell, he returned backe again ſaying, that he had rather be with his anceſtors. Whether of this <hi>Rabod</hi> our word <hi>Rahoudt,</hi> whereby in our Mother tongue we ſignifie a knaue and a wicked fellow, were deriued, I cannot tell. <hi>Suffridus Petrus Friſius</hi> hath written ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of the <hi>Frisij,</hi> in a ſeuerall and peculiar treatiſe dedicated wholly to this argument: <hi>Cornelius Kempius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue done the like: But <hi>Vbbo Emmius Friſius Gretenſis</hi> of all hath done the ſame moſt learnedly.</p>

Yea and the raging Ocean, a continuall and moſt noiſome enemie of this countrie, by ouerflowing, beating vpon it, tearing and rending his walls and banks hath much moleſted the ſame, and yet it will not ſuffer it to be quiet. Laſtly, how it hath of later daies been troubled by the Biſhops of <hi>Vtrecht</hi> and Earles of <hi>Holland,</hi> I thinke there is no man but doth well remember. But at length, in the daies of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, a very peaceable prince, it enioied peace and reſt from all former troubles.

            <p>The cities of Weſt <hi>Frieſland</hi> are thirteen, GROENINGEN, the more famous for that it brought forth the learned <hi>Rodolphus Agricola:</hi> DAM, LIEVVERDT with a faire caſtle: heere is kept the Court or place of Parliament and Chancerie, as they commonly call it: DOCKVM, the place where the famous Mathematician <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> was borne: FRANICHER, a common palace, and place of retreit whither the Noblemen and Gentry of this country do for their pleaſure retire themſelues: BOLSART, SNEECK, where <hi>Ioachim Hopper</hi> a very learned and worthy man, was borne: ILST, SLOTEN, HARLINGEN, vpon an arme of the German ocean; (which they call <hi>Suyderzee,</hi>) hath a commodious hauen; garded with a ſtrong caſtle to defend it from the impechment and aſſault of the enemie: WORCKVM and HINDELOPEN, vpon the ſame bay: Laſtly, STAVEREN, which in time paſt hath been a mighty city, but now hauing endured many bitter ſtorms and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of the ſea, it is nothing ſo renowmed nor great. There are beſide theſe 490. villages or pariſhes, of which diuers are endowed with great priuiledges, and haue many rich farmours: It hath many Monaſteries; ſo that for the beauty of their townes, husbandrie of the land, and ſtately Abbeies, <hi>Frieſland</hi> giueth place to no other country whatſoeuer. That in this prouince are many gentlemen deſcended from honourable families, hauing their houſes and farms in diuers places of the ſhire, and no Barons or free Lords, the cauſe is partly by reaſon of the foreſaid caſualities, and partly for that they being contented with their own eſtate and liberty, haue not followed the courts of forrein Princes.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the <hi>Frisij,</hi> did not in former times inhabit this tract, but the <hi>Cauchi,</hi> there is none, I thinke, that doubt. Beſide <hi>Strabo, Dion, Suetonius, Paterculus,</hi> and <hi>Ael. Spartianus, Ptolemey,</hi> (who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth them into <hi>The Greater,</hi> and <hi>The Leſſer,</hi>) doth make mention of this people. <hi>Ptolemey</hi> placeth the <hi>Greater Cauchi,</hi> between the riuers <hi>Weiſer</hi> and <hi>Elbe:</hi> the Leſſer, between <hi>Eems</hi> and <hi>Weiſer,</hi> where now theſe Frieſlanders, which we call <hi>Eaſt-Frieſlanders,</hi> at this day do dwell. Of the <hi>Cauchi, Pliny</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his ſixteenth booke, thus ſpeaketh: <hi>In the North we haue ſeene, ſaith he, the countries of the</hi> Cauchi, <hi>the Greater and the Leſſer, (as they are termed) altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void of wood and trees. For by an huge in-let there, twiſe euery day and night by courſes, the ſea runneth in amaine, confuſedly couering whatſoeuer generally the earth bringeth forth; leauing it doubtfull which is ſea, and which is land. There the ſilly diſtreſſed people get them vp to the toppes of high hills, or mounts raiſed, by labour and induſtrie of men, (according to the height of the higheſt tide, as they find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,) and thereon they build their poore cottages: where they dwell like ſailers floting on the waters, when the ocean flowing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſeth them round: or like thoſe which haue ſuffered ſhipwrake, when the waters ebbing returne backe againe: and then they go out to fiſh about their cabbines, when they obſerue the fiſh to follow the tide. They haue no cattell, they liue not vpon milke and whit-meats as their neighbours do, they hunt not any wild beaſt, as being farre from any ſhrubs or buſhes where they may hide their heads. Of Reike, a kind of ſeaweed, and ruſhes growing vpon the waſhes and boggy places they twiſt cords, whereof they make their fiſhing nets: and taking vp a kind of muddy earth with their hands, drying it rather with the wind, then with the ſunne, they vſe it for fuell to dreſſe their meat, and heat their limmes, ſtarke and ſtiffe with the cold blaſts of the Northren winds. They haue no other drinke but raine water, which they catch and keep in ditches in the porches of their houſes. Yet theſe nations, if they be at this day conquered by the Romanes, they count it no other but ſlauery and bondage. So it is indeed, fortune is fauourable to ſome to their owne hurt and hinderance.</hi> Thus <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth of this people; who wondereth that they preferred liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tyrannous command of the Romanes, or rather, as I thinke, he enuieth that they were freed from their yoke. For neither is it yet ſo wonderfull a thing as he would make it, for a free nation, before all things els whatſoeuer, to maintaine their liberty: which is excellent a thing in his iudgement, ô <hi>Pliny,</hi> whom thou thy ſelfe doeſt highly commend before all other, who perſwadeth vs to maintaine the ſame with the vttermoſt hazard of our life: and affirmeth it worthily to be deſired and preferred not only of man, but alſo of brute beaſts, before all things in the world beſide.</p>
            <p>This country in former times was diuided into many Signiories; which ſeuerally were gouerned by their ſeuerall and proper Princes, euen vnto the time of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the third, Emperour of <hi>Rome;</hi> who gaue this whole country vnto one <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,</hi> and created him Earle of the ſame, in the yeare after Chriſts natiuity 1465.</p>
            <p>The ſoile of this tract is ſo rich of all neceſſarie things, that it ſeemeth not greatly to ſtand in need of the help of neighbour countries. Yea it doth ſo plentifully abound with diuers things, as Horſes, Oxen, Cattell, Hogges, Wool, Butter, Cheeſe, Barley, Oates, Wheat, Beanes, Peaſe, and Salt, that from hence euery yeare they conuey great ſtore of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities vnto forrein countries. This County hath but two walled cities, namely, <hi>Eemden</hi> and <hi>Awricke.</hi> Of which EEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN, ſituate at the mouth of the riuer <hi>Eems,</hi> is the common Mart-towne of the whole prouince, for concourſe of Merchants eſpecially famous, which indeed is cauſed by the commodiouſneſſe and opportunity of the hauen, which doth thruſt it ſelfe ſo farre vp into the heart of the city, at ſuch a great height and depth, that it doth eaſily receiue and entertaine great ſhippes, full laden, with ſailes ſtricken into the very middeſt of the ſame. This city is much beautified with the ſumptuous palace of the Prince, a gorgeous Church, the Yeeld hall, and the goodly houſes of the priuate citizens. AVRICK, by reaſon of the woods and groues which on all ſides almoſt do incloſe it, is inhabitd for the moſt part of Gentlemen and Noblemen, where they recreate and delight themſelues with Hawking and Hunting. In the territorie of this city, there is, as <hi>Kempius</hi> reporteth, a place called <hi>Iyl,</hi> encloſed round with a wall, beſet with buſhes, a commodious dwelling for Hares and Deere: in which as in a Parke or warrein they maintaine a great number of theſe kind of beaſts, which none dare take vnder a great penalty: but they are reſerued for the Earles diſport and paſtime when he is diſpoſed to recreate himſelfe with hunting. In the confines alſo of this city <hi>Awricke,</hi> is a little hill riſing ſomewhat high, (commonly they call it <hi>Obſtalsboom</hi> or <hi>Vpſtalsbom</hi>) where the ſeat of Iuſtice or Court leet for the whole ſhire is ordinarily held. Heere they were wont euery yeare, out of all the Zelands, to meet in the open and wild fields, and there by the moſt skilfull and approued lawiers, ſuch as beſt knew their cuſtoms and lawes, to end and determine all controuerſies ariſing between man and man. In this precinct alſo are diuen caſtles, villages and farms. Of hamlets and end-waies, ſuch is the number, that oft times one doth touch another. The greateſt part of which both for beauty of their houſes and ſtreets, as alſo for multitude of inhabitants and ſtrangers, do ſo excell, that they may foe honour and greatneſſe contend with diuers cities of <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people do giue themſelues either to traffique as Merchants, or to get their liuings by occupations and handy-crafts, or by playing the husbandmen and tilling the ground. With their neighbours and forreners they ſpeake in the Dutch tongue, amongſt themſelues they vſe a peculiar language, proper to that nation and not vnderſtood of ſtrangers. They are comely apparelled, yea euen the very country people, ſo that a man would take them to be citizens. The women weare a kind of attire and apparell much differing from that of other nations. They bind vp all the haire of their had into one locke, and that, ſet out with diuers ſiluer and gilt ſpangles and buttons, they let to hang behind their backe. Their head they bind vp in Summer with a caull of red coloured ſilke, behung with ſiluer ſpangles, but in the Winter they weare an hood of green cloth, wherewith they do ſo couer their whole head, that skarſely one may ſee their eies: this kind of attire they call an <hi>Hatte.</hi> Their vpper garment (<hi>huick</hi> of looſe gowne) which they weare abroad, from the head to the foot is pleited with many ſmall pleits, and is ſo ſtiffe with ſiluer and gilt wire or plate wouen into it, that when it is put off, it will ſtand vpright. This ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is made of red, ſometime of green cloth. In this country of <hi>Eaſt-Frieſland</hi> there are alſo two other counties, the one called <hi>Eſens,</hi> the other <hi>Ieueren,</hi> bearing the names of their chiefe towns. Of the ſituation of this prouince, nature and maners of the people, read <hi>Vbbo Emmius.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Axo Grammaticus</hi> hath thus deſcribed <hi>Denmarke:</hi> DENMARKE, ſaith he, parted in the middeſt by the boiſterous ſea, conteineth a few ſmall parts of the maine continent, ſeuered and diſioined one from another by the breaking in of the ocean winding and turning it ſelfe diuers waies. Of theſe IVTIA, <hi>Iuitland,</hi> is, in reſpect of the greatneſſe and beginning, in the enterance of the kingdome of <hi>Denmarke.</hi> Which as it is in ſituation firſt, ſo running out further, it is placed in the vtmoſt borders of <hi>Germany.</hi> From whoſe company it being parted by the intercourſe of the riuer <hi>Eydor,</hi> it runneth with a larger breadth toward the North, euen to the banke of the frith of <hi>Norwey</hi> (he calleth it <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Noricum.</hi>) In this is the bay of <hi>Lemwicke, (Sinus Lymicus)</hi> abounding with ſuch ſtore of fiſh, that it alone yeeldeth as much prouiſion of victuall to the inhabitants, as all the whole country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. To this is adioined FRESIA, <hi>(Strand Frieſen)</hi> a prouince much leſſer, which lying more low then <hi>Iuitland</hi> in plaine and champion fields, receiueth from the ſea ouerflowing it, great ſtrength and heart, and is very ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile for come. Whoſe inundation or violent tide, whether it do bring to the country people more profit or dammage, it is hard to ſay: For in tempeſtuous weather the Sea breaking in through the creeks wherein the water was wont to be contained, ſuch a world of waters oft times doth follow and come into the country, that diuers times it runneth ouer not only the fallow fields, but drowneth alſo whole families with their goods and cattell. After <hi>Iuitland,</hi> the ile FIONIA, <hi>(Fuinex)</hi> doth follow vpon the Eaſt, which a narrow arme of the ocean ſea doth ſeuer from the maine land. This iland as vpon the Weſt it looketh toward <hi>Iuitland,</hi> ſo vpon the Eaſt it hath the ile SEELAND, (<hi>Sialandia,</hi> he calleth it) an iland much commended for the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all maner of neceſſary things that it yeeldeth: which for pleaſant ſituation is thought to excell all the prouinces of this kingdome, and is ſuppoſed to be in the middeſt of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> indifferently ſituate between the one end of the ſame, and the other. Vpon the Eaſt ſide of this, an arme of the ocean runneth between it and SCONE, (<hi>Scania, Scandinauia, Baſilia</hi> and <hi>Baltia</hi> called by diuers authours) a part of <hi>Norwey</hi> or <hi>Swedland.</hi> This ſea yearely affoordeth great gaine to the Fiſhermen. For this whole bay or gulfe of the ſea, is ſo full of all ſorts of fiſh, that the fiſhermen oft times do catch ſuch ſtore and therewith they ſo fraight their boats, that they haue no roome to ſtirre their oares: neither do they heere vſe any nets or other meanes to take the fiſh, but many times they are taken only with the hand. Moreouer HALLAND and BLIEKER, (<hi>Blekingia</hi> he nameth it) two prouinces, iſſuing forth from the maine land of <hi>Scone,</hi> like two armes from one and the ſame body of a tree, are, by many ſpaces and by-corners, adioined and knitte to <hi>Gotland</hi> and <hi>Norwey.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Saxo Grammaticus.</hi> See alſo <hi>Albert Crantzius, Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Munſter,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory of <hi>M.

            </p>
            <p>GOTHIA, or the ile <hi>Gotland</hi> is a good ground for the feeding and bringing vp of cattell, horſes and oxen. There is plentifull fiſhing, fowling and hunting. It is very rich of a kind of faire marble, as alſo of all maner of things neceſſary for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of mans life. In it is the goodly towne <hi>Visbui,</hi> ſometime the moſt famous and frequent Mart of all <hi>Europe.</hi> There are yet remaining certaine ruines of marble, ſufficient teſtimony of his ancient greatneſſe and beauty: at this day it is now renowmed for the faire Abbey of Benedictine Friers; and the Library there containing about 2000. bookes of ſundry authours, rare and ancient manuſcripts.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey are three Ilands perteining to <hi>Pomerland,</hi> RVGIA, <hi>Rugen,</hi> VSEDAMIA, <hi>Vſedom,</hi> and WOLLINIA, <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> the more famous for their three Market townes, <hi>Vineta, Arcona</hi> and <hi>Iulina.</hi> VINETA, a goodly towne of <hi>Vſedome,</hi> which <hi>Conrad</hi> the ſecond Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Salignus,</hi> by the helpe of <hi>Canutus</hi> king of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> deſtroied in the yeare of Chriſt, 1036. hauing ſtood in flouriſhing eſtate about 250. yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the quarrell grew, as they report, for that they had vſed certaine Chriſtian Merchants trading thither, very deſpightfully and cruelly. It was not ſituate, as <hi>Crantzius</hi> affirmeth, neere the mouth of the riuer <hi>Diuenow,</hi> or vpon the Eaſt ſide of the creeke, where the new lake emptieth it ſelfe into the ſea. For it is from thence ſeuen miles Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, two miles Southward from the ſtrong caſtell <hi>Wolgaſt.</hi> At this day the foundation of it is yet to be ſeene in the ſea, about thirty furlongs from the ſhore, or from the fiſher-mens cottages in <hi>Damerow.</hi> It ſeemeth to haue beene welnigh as bigge as <hi>Lubecke.</hi> Toward the latter end of winter, the ice of the marine quarters there about are gathered together and do ſtay vpon theſe breaches, and oft times it appeareth a farre off like a Caſtell or Bulwarke. Heere the Seales <hi>(Phocae)</hi> do caſt their yong and bring them vp in the ſommer time, (the Eaſt ſea being calme,) vpon the cragges and rocks there. And been they ſleepe vpon the toppes of the cliffes and rocks which am aboue the waters. Theſe do much hurt to the poore fiſher-men that dwell heere about; eating vp the laxes and other fiſhes, which they catch with hookes.</p>
               <p>ARCONA, now the ſea-men vulgarly call it <hi>Ormunde.</hi> In the neckeland of <hi>Rugen,</hi> was <hi>Wittow</hi> or <hi>Witmund,</hi> as the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders call it, of the high white chalkie cliffes vpon the ſea-coaſt. This iland is diuided into many ſmall iles and neck-lands: It hath in all 28. pariſh Churches. <hi>Waldemare</hi> king of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> in the yeare of Chriſt, 1168. ſpoiled <hi>Arcona. Ottocare</hi> king of the Romanes and of all <hi>Italie,</hi> was borne in <hi>Rugen,</hi> as alſo diuers other famous captaines, renowmed in hiſtories, and regiſtred by <hi>Francis Ireney.</hi> In our time it hath brought forth many learned noble men, which haue beene of the Councell to Kings and great Princes.</p>
               <p>IVLINVM, now <hi>Wollin,</hi> ſtood longeſt. This ouercame the fleet royall and great armado of <hi>Swein</hi> the firſt, king of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and tooke him thriſe in three ſeuerall battels at ſea; yet was three times reſcued and releaſed our of their hands againe. <hi>Iulinum</hi> ſtood in that place or there about where now the towne <hi>Wollin</hi> is ſeated, as the monuments in the places neere adioining do ſufficiently teſtifie. Saint <hi>Otto</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bamberg,</hi> the Apoſtle of <hi>Pomerland,</hi> in the yeare 1124. in this towne baptized 22000. men. Heere the Prince of <hi>Pomerland</hi> erected a Biſhops ſea, and <hi>Albertus</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Pomerland,</hi> was firſt inſtalled Biſhop of the ſame. Yet the citizens and people about <hi>Iulinum</hi> did ſoone fall backe to paganiſme and do againe adore their idoll <hi>Trigilaff,</hi> and vtterly forſooke Chriſt: and therefore fire fell downe from heauen, and waſted the city. <hi>Waldemare</hi> alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the fire, two yeares, after the ouerthrow of <hi>Arcona,</hi> raſed <hi>Iulinum</hi> to the ground.

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the MARSI, deſcended from <hi>Marſus, Strabo</hi> the ancient Geographer ſpeaketh: and ſaith that many yeares ſince they went from the coaſts about the <hi>Rhein,</hi> into a low and mooriſh country. Of theſe are come the THEVTOMARSI, or, as they commonlie pronounce the word, the <hi>Thietmarſi,</hi> (the Dietmarſhers) who about 400. yeares agone, were gouerned by the moſt ancient family of <hi>Staden,</hi> many of which they treacherouſly ſlew, and ſo at length they made themſelues free, by killing &amp; baniſhing all their Nobility. <hi>Henry,</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Lion,</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſubdued them: but he being out-lawed by the Emperour <hi>Fredericke, Walemare</hi> king of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ſeized vpon the country, and when as he vſed their helpe againſt <hi>Adolph</hi> Earle of <hi>Holſtein</hi> and the Lubeckers, they reuolted vnto the enemies, by whom the king was ouercome at the village <hi>Bornhouet.</hi> Thus againe being reſtored vnto their liberty, leaſt they might ſeeme to be <hi>Anarchi,</hi> ſubiect to no Iuriſdiction, they ſhrowded themſelues vnder the patronage of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſhop of <hi>Breme,</hi> and him they acknowledged for their Prince: but yet they would neuer pay him tribute or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie, nor euer would be obedient to his lawes or commands. Often the Dukes of <hi>Holſtein</hi> haue attempted wars againſt them, and alwaies they ſuffered the repulſe. <hi>Fredericke</hi> the third, Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> gaue the country to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the firſt, king of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> vnder the title of a Dukedome: whoſe ſonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> making war vpon them in the yeare 1500. loſt the day, all his forces being ouerthrowen, himſelfe with a very few hardly eſcaped by flight, leauing behind him the greateſt part of the nobility of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> After that, they grew more inſolent by this victory, and oft greatly troubled and moleſted the Duke of <hi>Holſtein. Adolph</hi> ſonne of <hi>Fredericke</hi> king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> heire to the kingdome of <hi>Norway,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Sleſwicke</hi> and <hi>Holſtein,</hi> not being able to endure their male-part inſolencie, in the yeare of Chriſt 1559. muſtereth his men, gathereth a great army, to whom <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond, king of <hi>Demnarke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> his brother, ioine their forces. Theſe armies thus vnited, ſet forward, and preſently take <hi>Meldorp,</hi> with all the South part of the prouince. Then after a few daies reſpite, they ledde their forces along by <hi>Tilenbrugge,:</hi> againſt whom the Dietmarſhers out of <hi>Hemmingstade</hi> make head with all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and met the enemy before the towne <hi>Heyde;</hi> entending to force the ſouldiers to retire being wearied with a tedious march: but oft repelled, and yet charging againe afreſh, at length they are beaten downe, killed, forced to flie, and the towne is taken and fired. There were ſlaine that day about 3000. Dietmarſhers. Duke <hi>Adolph</hi> labouring like a valiant captaine, to keep his men in aray, and to bring them on againe which began to flie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued an hurt. This battell was fought vpon the thirteenth day of Iune. The Dietmarſhers hauing receiued this ouerthrow, ſubmitted themſelues to the King and the Dukes, and obteining pardon, they were againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to grace: and thus <hi>Dietmarſh,</hi> which for many ages together by force of armes had defended and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their liberty, became ſubiect to the Dukes of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> This the authour of this Mappe, which heere we haue inſerted into our Theater, hath written of this country.

            <p>Of the Marqueſate of BRANDENBVRG, LVSATIA, <hi>(Lauſſnitz)</hi> and VOITLAND, countries which we haue alſo deſcribed in this Chart, take theſe few lines; The Marqueſate of BRANDENBVRG, one of thoſe prouinces which in old time were inhabited of the <hi>Wandalls,</hi> is diuided at this day into the Old and the New; by this runneth the riuer <hi>Oder,</hi> by that <hi>Elue, Albis</hi> the Latines call it. In the old Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſate the chiefe city is <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> whereof the whole country tooke his name. The New hath the city <hi>Franckford:</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Franckford</hi> vpon <hi>Oder,</hi> to make a difference between it and that which is ſituate vpon the riuer <hi>Meyn.</hi> Heere is an Vniuerſitie, and a great Mart kept twiſe euery yeare. At <hi>Berline;</hi> is the Princes court ordinarily kept. Him, of the Marqueſate they commonly call the <hi>Marqueſſe:</hi> he alſo is one of the Prince Electours.</p>
            <p>VOITLAND is a little ſhire ſubiect to the Marqueſſe. This <hi>Aeneas Syluius</hi> calleth <hi>Aduocatorum terram,</hi> and <hi>Praetorianam,</hi> the Sollicitours or Controwlers land, framing a word from the Etymologie or true meaning of the Germaine name; for <hi>Voyt,</hi> in the Dutch tongue ſignifieth a Sollicitour or Controwler. So called for that ſometime the Prince of this country was one of the foure controwlers of the Roman Empire. The townes of better note are theſe, as <hi>Gaſper Bruſchius</hi> thus reckoneth them vp in Munſters Coſmographie: <hi>Curia Regnitiana, Renitz</hi> court, commonly called <hi>Hoff,</hi> (ſo named of the riuers which runne by it and there falling into <hi>Sala,</hi>) a great city and very populous, beautified with the goodly and ſtately Church of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> a large Monaſtery of Nunnes, and two rich Hoſpitalls. <hi>Plauhenium,</hi> or <hi>Plaun;</hi> a city with a caſtell. <hi>Olſnitz,</hi> which the caſtell <hi>Voytzberg,</hi> neere adioining. <hi>Adorff,</hi> and <hi>Weidonium, (Weyda</hi> as I thinke) a faire towne, with certaine Abbeies about them, <hi>Milford</hi> and <hi>VVhite-crowne, Geraw Scletz,</hi> and whatſoeuer is between the <hi>Hoff</hi> and <hi>Cygney,</hi> ſtanding vpon the riuer <hi>Elſter, (Halleſtra,</hi> the Latines call it.) Neere vnto this is <hi>Feichtelberg,</hi> that famous mountaine bearing plentifully the ſtately Pine-trees, out of which foure riuers do ariſe &amp; runne, (a very ſtrange worke of Nature) vnto foure quarters of the world: namely, <hi>Egre, Meyn, Nabe,</hi> and <hi>Sala. VVolfangus Iobſtius</hi> hath written a curious deſcription of the Marque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LVSATIA, <hi>Lauſſnitz,</hi> is diuided into <hi>Ober Lauſſnitz,</hi> and <hi>Nider Lauſſnitz,</hi> the Vpper, and the Neather: it is alſo is a part of <hi>Saxony,</hi> as <hi>Rithaymer</hi> teſtifieth. It lieth between the riuers <hi>Elue</hi> and <hi>Oder,</hi> and the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian mountaines. Sometime it was a part of <hi>Meiſen, (Miſnia,)</hi> and was adioined to it: but the Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; who laboured by all meanes to enlarge the bounds of their kingdome and command, at length ſeized it into their hands. The people in maners, conditions and language do not much differ from the Sileſians: only they are diſtinct from them by name, and iuriſdiction, as gouerned by ſeuerall Princes. The name and appellation of <hi>Luſatia,</hi> is ſomewhat neere in ſound to the name of <hi>Elysij,</hi> or <hi>Lygij,</hi> which it is certaine, as <hi>Ioachinus Cureus</hi> writeth, ſometime dwelt heere about. Their chiefe cities are <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> and <hi>Sittaw,</hi> and ſome others. The riuer <hi>Neiſſ</hi> runneth through the middeſt of this country. <hi>Gaſper Peucer,</hi> hath this other day in Elegiacke verſe, deſcribed the ſame in a pecular treatiſe. MISNIA, <hi>(Meiſen)</hi> and THVRINGIA, <hi>(Thuringen)</hi> are deſcribed and ſet out in their ſeuerall tables, which we haue heereafter inſerted into this our Theater of the World in their proper places. A portraiture and draught of theſe countries, ſhaddowed and counterfeited out of the Geographicall Chart of <hi>Iohn Criginger,</hi> which was imprinted at <hi>Prage</hi> in <hi>Bohemia</hi> in the yeare of Chriſt 1568. we haue adioined to this our worke.</p>

            <head>The county of MANSFIELD.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANSFIELD, a part of Old Saxonie, is thought to haue beene ſo called of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> the ſecond king of the Germanes: For <hi>Manſueldt,</hi> in this country ſpeech, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſignifie nothing elſe, but <hi>The field of Mannus.</hi> Which deriuation <hi>Aſcanien,</hi> another place not far from hence, denominated, as ſome men do verily beleeue, of <hi>Aſcenez,</hi> the firſt authour of the Germane name and nation, doth ſeeme ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confirme. Heere alſo is <hi>Aſcher leuben,</hi> which in their language is as much to ſay, as, <hi>The houſe of Aſchenez.</hi> There is alſo a lake, which of Aſcenez, is called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcherſlebiſche ſee.</hi> This countrie hath vpon the Eaſt, the riuer Sala, the territories of the Archbiſhopricke of Magdeburg, and the Dioceſſe of Merſeburg: on the South lieth, Turingen; on the Weſt, the Counties of Swartzburg, and Stolberg, the Principalities of Sangerhouſe, Anhalt, and Aſſeburg. So that theſe Earles of Mansfield (which are alſo called, <hi>The noble Lords of Heldrungen</hi>) haue theſe princes their neere neighbours: the Archbiſhop of Magdeburg, the biſhop of Merſeburg, the Prince Electour of Saxony, the Landgraue of Thuringia, the Duke of Saxony, the biſhop of Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtade, the Prince of Anhald, the Lord of Bernburg, the Earles of Swartzburg and Stolburg, the Lords of Werther and Aſſeburg.</p>
            <p>When, or by whom, this prouince was graced with the title of an EARLDOME, Andrew Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penrode, in his booke, which he hath written &amp; ſet forth of the Petigrees of the Saxon Princes, plainly confeſſeth that he is altogether ignorant. Notwithſtanding this ſame authour, and with him Syriacus Spangeberg, do auerre it to haue beene very ancient, by this, that an Earle of this country, called Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, did liue in the daies of Great Arthur, that renowmed king of the Britans, and was one of thoſe, which together with the reſt of the worthies of this king, were firſt made <hi>Knights of the order of the Round Table.</hi> Now this king Arthur, we know liued about 542. yeres after the incarnation of our Sauior Chriſt. But if there be any man that ſhall thinke and obiect, that this ſtorie of the Round Table is too fabulous to confirme this our aſſertion, yet this is certaine and cannot be doubted of, that in England, almoſt in the middeſt of the kingdome, there is a towne called Mansfield, ſituate betweeene the riuers of Trent and Rotheram, not farre from the city of Nottingham.</p>
            <p>This county containeth alſo foure other counties: namely, ARNSTEDT, WIPRA, WETHIN and QVERNFVRT, all which in former times had their proper and peculiar Earles, but now at this day beſide the counte Mansfield they haue not any one. In this county alſo there is the county Palatine of Saxony. Moreouer there are beſide theſe certaine other Lordſhips and Principalities, as thou maiſt ſee in the Mappe. The chiefe and principall cities are MANSFIELD, EYSLEBEN, WIPRA and LEIMBACH.</p>
            <p>This country is very full of Mettall-mines. Heere out of the earth are digged thoſe ſleitſtones, which they call <hi>Scheyfferſteyn,</hi> ſuch as ſcarcely are to be found, as Sebaſtian Munſter writeth, in any other place of the world beſide. It hath alſo certaine ſtones laden with Copper, which being burnt in the fire and then ſteeped and waſhed in water do yeeld the mettall, and together with it ſome good ſtore of Siluer. But this is a wonderfull ſtrange pranke, that Nature heere in ſporting maner vſually plaieth, which the ſame authour there ſpeaketh of well worth the obſeruation: namely of a great Lake in this country well ſtored with diuers and ſundry ſorts of fiſh: all which kinds of fiſh, together with the paddockes, frogs, newts, and ſuch other things liuing in this lake, are found ſo curiouſly expreſſed &amp; ſhaped out in ſtones, as we haue to our great admiration beheld, as it is a very hard matter at the firſt ſight vpon the ſudden to diſcern them from the naturall liuing creatures of that kind, and that ſo liuelily that thou ſhalt be able preſently to diſtinguiſh one from another and to call them by their ſeuerall and proper names. Some of theſe I haue, giuen me by Peter Erneſt, the moſt renowmed and illuſtrious Earle of this country, and worthy Gouernour of the prouince of Lutzenburg.</p>
            <p>There is a Lake in this country, which, by reaſon of the ſaltneſſe of the water, they call <hi>Geſaltzen,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, if the fiſhermen ſhall caſt in their nets ouer deepe, they will preſently be ſienged &amp; ſchorched euen as if they had beene burnt or drawne through the fire, as Seuerinus Gobelinus, in his hiſtory of Amber, reporteth. The ſame authour writeth that neere vnto Eiſleben, there was not long ſince a piece of Amber found as bigge as a mans head.</p>
            <p>Syriacus Spangeberg did promiſe to ſet out the hiſtory of this countrey, wherin all the cities, caſtles, villages, mountaines, woods, riuers, lakes, mines &amp;c. ſhould ſeuerally be deſcribed; together with the Antiquities, Records, Petigrees, and ſuch other hiſtoricall matters of the ſame.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He terrirory and precinct of the Princes of HENNENBERG, a part of Eaſt France, how large and wide it was, you may ſee by this our Chorographicall Mappe; the buts and bounds of it are thus: Vpon the Weſt and North it hath Thuringen, and the great foreſt, which of this countrie is called <hi>Durynger Waldt;</hi> (whoſe head on theſe parts doth diuide Thuringen from Frankenland) on the South it is confined with the riuer of Meyn, and the biſhoprickes of Bamberg and Wuitzburg. Moreouer the Eaſt part is encloſed with that great mountaine which the country people do call, <hi>Die Rhon,</hi> or <hi>Roſn:</hi> vpon the ſame ſide alſo it hath the Dioceſſe of Fulden, and the prouince of Heſſen.

               </gap>e properly, it is of ſome in other places called <hi>Die Weſſer,</hi> which indeed the name of the Abbey <hi>Veſſer</hi> doth ſeeme to approoue for truth: which Francis Irenicus and Wolfgangus Lazius do verily beleeue to haue beene ſo denominated of <hi>Waſſer,</hi> which in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane is as much to ſay, as <hi>water,</hi> in the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt beginning and originall of this houſe or family of Hennenberg, by reaſon of the negligence of the writers and Hiſtorians of thoſe times, we can determine nothing for certainty, beſide this, that in the time of Attila and Charles the Great, ſome authours do make mention of the Princes of Hennenberg, which alſo were Earles of Frankland and Burggraues of Wurtzeburg. So againe in the time of Henry the firſt, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Germany, Gottwald and Otto of this houſe of Hennenberg, ſerued valiantly in defence of the Empire againſt the aſſaults and inrodes of the <hi>Vgri.</hi> Item the <hi>Boppones,</hi> two learned men of this family, in the yeares of Chriſt 941. and 961. were biſhops of Wurtzeburg, and gouerned that ſea with the great applauſe and praiſe of all men. But the true pedigree of theſe Princes is deriued from BOPPO, who in the yeare of our Lord 1078. following Henry the fourth, the Emperours ſide, in the battell fought betweene him and Rudolph the Switzer, neere to the city Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richſtadt, valiantly fighting was honourablie ſlaine in the field. After him ſucceeded his ſonne GOTTEBALD, firſt founder of the Abbey of Veſſer, for the Monkes of the order of the brotherhood of the Praemonſtratenſes: After him followed his ſonne BERTHOLD; then BOPPO the Second, next him BOPPO the Third, all which ſucceeded one after another in a right line. This Boppo the Third had by his ſecond wife <hi>Iut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> of Thuringen, HERMAN, whoſe ſonne BOPPO the Fourth died, leauing no iſſue behind him: But by his firſt wife <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of the familie of the Princes of Saxony, he had HENRY, who had iſſue HENRY the Second, HERMAN the Second, and BERTHOLD the Second: Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had iſſue BOPPO the Fift; whoſe ſonne BERTHOLD the Third died without iſſue. But after Herman theſe Princes, HENRY the Second, HERMAN the Third, FREDERICK the Firſt, GEORGE the Firſt, and laſtly FREDERICK the Second lineally deſcended one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſucceſſiuely gouerned this prouince. This Fredericke had iſſue HERMAN, who by his wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> of the family of Brandenburg had two ſonnes, BERTHOLD the Fourth, and ALBERT, both which died in the yeare of our Lord God, 1549. and left no iſſue behind them. Then of the line of Berthold the Second, third ſonne of Henry the Firſt, ſucceeded BERTHOLD the Fift, who for his ſingular virtues, wiſedome, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and excellent gifts other waies, was in the yeare after Chriſts incarnation, 1310. by Henry of Lutzelburg the Emperour, with the generall conſent of the whole company of the Electours, inſtalled one of the Princes of the Empire. And after that, for the ſame his virtues, and for that he was in managing all maner of buſineſſes a moſt prudent, faithfull and fortunate man, by Lewis the Fourth, the next ſucceſſour in the Empire, much ſet by and greatly eſteemed. In his time, this whole prouince as it is heere ſet out, in this our Chorographicall Chart, was ſubiect to him and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes and Earles of Hennenberg then liuing. But HENRY his ſonne dying without iſſue male, the greateſt part of this countrey, by the marriage of his three daughters, KATHARINE, SOPHIA, and ELIZABETH, fell vnto the Marqueſſes of Miſnia, Burggraues of Noriberg, and Princes of Wurtenburg, which two laſt ſelling their portions, the biſhop of Wurtenburg did much enlarge his dioceſſe. IOHN, the ſecond ſonne of Berthold the firſt, by his wife <hi>Adelheida</hi> of the houſe of Heſſen, had by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of the family of Luchtenburg, a ſonne named HENRY the Fourth, who by <hi>Mechtilda,</hi> or Mawd, daughter to the Marqueſſe of Bath, WILLIAM the Firſt, who by his wife <hi>Anna</hi> of Brunſwicke, had WILLIAM the Second, which by <hi>Katharine,</hi> Counteſſe of Hanaw, had iſſue WILLIAM the Fourth, begotten of his wife <hi>Margaret</hi> daughter to the Duke of Brunſwicke. This William had by his wife <hi>Anaſtaſia,</hi> daughter of Albert, Prince Electour of Brandenburg, ſeuen <hi>ſonnes,</hi> and ſix <hi>daughters,</hi> namely WILLIAM, and CASPAR, which died in their infancy: IOHN, Abbot of Fulden: WOLFGANG and CHRISTOPHER, which two died bachelours: GEORGE ERNEST and BOPPO the Sixt: This Boppo, after the death of his firſt wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter to the Marqueſſe of Brandenburg, maried <hi>Sophia,</hi> daughter to the Prince of Luneburg; he died vpon the fourth of March in the yeere of our Lord 1574. leauing no iſſue behind him. He was a very godly, prudent, magnanimous and curtuous Prince. That other, George Erneſt, after the death of his wife <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter to the Duke of Brunſwicke, maried <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter to the Prince of Wurtenburg, and at length vpon the ſeuen and twentieth day of December in the yeare of our Lord God 1583. yeelded to Nature and died in the ſeuentie and third yeare of his age, being the laſt Prince of that ſtocke or family. The deſcription of this prouince of Hennenberg, as heere it is ſet downe, at this day is ſubiect vnto diuers Princes: the greateſt part of it, belongeth to the Duke of Saxony, the reſt to the biſhop of Wurtenburg and the Landtgraues of Heſſen. A more large and exact deſcription of this Stocke and Family, if any man be deſirous to haue, may be learned out of the Genealogy or Pedigree of M.

The length of this country, which is equall to the breadth, is about twelue Germane miles. In this narrow compaſſe, (as I remember not long ſince Hugh Brinkhorſt, an Engliſhman, a citizen of Erford, my good friend, did tell me) there are 12.

PARISHES, and 150. CASTLES. It is a paſsing fertile country, and of wheat and ſuch like corne it yeeldeth greater plenty than any other country of Germany whatſoeuer. Whereupon George Agricola doubted not to call it <hi>Sumen Germaniae,</hi> The Sweet-bread of Germany. Heere yearely groweth great plenty of woad (<hi>Iſatis,</hi> the Latines call it) which from hence is tranſported into other countries, to the great gaine and commodity of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants: It is an herbe or weed much vſed of Diers, to ſet the more perfect and durable colour in wooll or wollen cloth.

Zacharias Riuander, in the Dutch tongue hath ſet out a peculiar treatiſe containing a deſcription of this countrie.</p>
            <p>The Metropolitane or chiefe city of this prouince is <hi>Erford,</hi> which is held to be the greateſt city of all Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. The cryſtall and nimble ſtreamed Gera runneth almoſt through euery ſtreet of this city, as we there beheld to our great delight and exceeding commodity of the people inhabiting the ſame. In it there is a mount vpon the which doth ſtand a goodly Monaſtery of Frier Benedictines, dedicated vnto S. Peter. Here alſo is a ſtately church, built by Boniface biſhop of Mentz, and dedicated to our Lady Mary, the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe two regions are at this preſent ſubiect to one Prince. They are both named of the principall cities, <hi>Brunſwijck</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg.</hi> The city of <hi>Brunſwijck</hi> was about the yeere 860. built by <hi>Bruno</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ludolphus,</hi> who (as <hi>Crantzius</hi> ſaith) firſt erected a ſtreet or borough, calling it <hi>Brunonis vicus,</hi> whereupon the whole citie hath euer ſince beene called <hi>Brunſwijck.</hi> A place of great renowme, ſituate in the midſt of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> vpon the riuer <hi>Onadri,</hi> which falles into the <hi>Weſer.</hi> The beginnings of this towne were ſmall. Howbeit in proceſſe of time, and by degrees, it is now growen to ſuch ſtate, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſtrength, as the Princes thereof are worthily called Dukes of <hi>Brunſwijck.</hi> But it was very long firſt. For of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times they bare only the title of Lords: but vnder <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, in the yeere 1235, renewing their ſtile, they were ordained Dukes. This is one of the ſeuentie Hanſe-townes. From which ſocietie, by a generall Councell of all the ſaid townes held at <hi>Lubeck anno</hi> 1381, they were excluded, in regard of a moſt cruell and bloudy ſedition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the greateſt part of their Aldermen they ſlue, and the reſt they baniſhed. And ſo they were depriued of the benefit of the ſaid ſocietie for eight yeeres, vntill they had done publike penance and ſatisfaction. From which time they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted anew into the ſaid incorporation of the Hanſe: that is to ſay, to be partakers of all priuileges granted by Princes and gouernours of former times to all that were free of the ſaid ſocietie, in thoſe foure famous marts; to wit, <hi>London</hi> in <hi>England, Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders, Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> and <hi>Nouogrod</hi> in <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> Their tutelary ſaint or protectour they holde to be <hi>S. Anthor</hi> the Confeſſor, whilome Biſhop of <hi>Triers.</hi> For the honour of whoſe body, becauſe it could not be brought within their city walles, they erected a monaſtery vnder the title of <hi>S. Giles,</hi> then neere vnto the walles; but now (the city being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged) within the ſame. Thus much out of <hi>Crantzius</hi> his ſtory of <hi>Saxonie</hi> and <hi>Wandalia.</hi> The praiſe of this citie you may finde in <hi>Aeneas Siluius</hi> his 23. chap. of <hi>Europe.</hi> The citie of LVNEBVRG, built about the yeere of Chriſt 1190. vpon an hill named <hi>Calcarium,</hi> was ſo called, not (as the ignorant imagine) from <hi>Idolum lunae</hi> the idol of the moone, which <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> or I wot not who, did there conſecrate; for this is but an old wiues tale;) but from a place not farre off by the riuer <hi>Elmenou</hi> called <hi>Luna,</hi> where there hath for many yeeres continued a cloiſter of Nunnes. It is a citie of great ſtrength, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with ditches and walles. The citizens greateſt traffique is for ſalt: for here are moſt plentifull and rich ſalt-pits, out of which they raiſe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gaines. For ſalt is here boiled in great quantitie, and vented from hence both by ſea and land to <hi>Hamborough, Lubeck,</hi> and other places. Theſe ſalt-mines were firſt found in the yeere of Chriſt 1269. This city of <hi>Luneburg</hi> with the territory adiacent, is in a peculiar Treatiſe deſcribed by <hi>Lucas Loſſius.</hi> Of <hi>Hildeſheim</hi> fiue miles diſtant from <hi>Brunſwijck, M. Antonie Mockerus,</hi> a citizen thereof, hath written alſo a peculiar diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In this Table vpon the riuer <hi>Weſer</hi> or <hi>Viſurgis</hi> ſtands the citie of <hi>Hamelen;</hi> concerning which, the learned and famous Phyſitian <hi>D. Arnold Fretaghius</hi> wrote to me in a letter the ſtory enſuing; his words be theſe: I chanced of late to light vpon a Saxon, and a Chronicler of <hi>Saxonie.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">He reports, that 130. yeres ago the citie of <hi>Hamelen,</hi> vnder the iuriſdiction of Duke <hi>Ericus,</hi> being exceedingly peſtered with mice, there came a iugler that offered his ſeruice to the townes-men to driue them away: this offer was moſt acceptable vnto them, becauſe they could keepe nothing in ſafetie from thoſe miſchieuous vermine. Being agreed with the townes-men, by the ſound of a bell he drawes all the mice out of the citie. Then he demandeth his promiſed hire. They denie it him. Well, in a great rage he departs the citie, and within a yeere after returneth; and ſounding the ſame bell which before he had vſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure the mice, he drew after him vnto an hill not farre off, a great number of the citizens children; whither being come, both they and he immediatly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. A girle of the company, either for wearineſſe, or by Gods appointment, ſtayeth a good diſtance behinde: who returning home, and being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what ſhe ſaw, makes report, that her fellowes were gone vp the hill with the iugler. Then euery man runnes to ſeeke his childe; but in vaine: for from that time forward they could neuer know what was become of them. Hauing read this, I iudged it either to be a fable, or (as it is in very deed) a moſt wonderfull and ſtrange narration. Diſcourſing therefore with certaine citizens of this place, I made mention heereof. They all affirmed it to be true, and ſayd, that the yeere, the day, and the number of children that were loſt, was regiſtred in the records of the citie of <hi>Hamelen:</hi> and it is yet a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among them, in their bonds and couenants which they write in an ancient hand, to vſe this forme or clauſe of ſpeech, <hi>Don onſer kinder auſgangh,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>From the departure of our children.</hi> And they ſay, that the way or ſtreet thorow which they were led, for the perpetuall memorie of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, was called by the inhabitants, <hi>Die Bungloeſe ſtraeſs:</hi> and that it is not lawfull thereto ring a bell. If you haue perhaps read this ſtorie heretofore, I doe now call it to your remembrance. If you know any thing that may ſtand me in ſtead, I pray you impart it as leaſure and occaſion ſhall ſerue. Fare you well, and loue your <hi>Fretaghius.</hi> From <hi>Groenninghen</hi> the ninth of Nouember 1580.</q>

               <head>A deſcription of the territory of NVRENBERG.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of <hi>Pighius</hi> his <hi>Hercules Prodicius</hi> I haue thought good to ſet downe the originall and deſcription of this place: his words be theſe: When the barbarous <hi>Hunnes</hi> ouerran a great part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and oppreſſed alſo the people <hi>Norici</hi> inhabiting <hi>Bauaria,</hi> certaine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall families of them for ſhelter and refuge fled vnto the forreſt <hi>Hercynia,</hi> planting themſelues in a commodious place by the riuers of <hi>Pegnitz</hi> and <hi>Regnitz;</hi> and ſo vpon an hill by nature ſtrongly ſituate, and free from hoſtile incurſions, they built them a rude and homely caſtle, as the Chronicles of <hi>Bauaria</hi> doe beare record. Within a while their number was increaſed by the neighbour-husbandmen and the ſhepheards of the forreſt <hi>Hercynia:</hi> and ſo of a medley of diuers ſorts and profeſsions of people, they grew at laſt to the bigneſſe of a towne. But giuing themſelues to a baſe and diſſolute kinde of life, without gouernours, without lawes, and continually moleſting the neighbour Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces with riots and robberies, it ſeemed good to the German Emperours to ſend thither a colonie of olde ſouldiers, which might ſerue in ſtead of a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon for the place, to bridle their outrages, and to preſcribe vnto them lawes of ciuilitie. Some report, that <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bauaria</hi> firſt brought it into the forme of a citie, adorned it with the church of <hi>S. Giles,</hi> enacted lawes, and enuironed the caſtle with a larger wall. Alſo, that <hi>Conradus</hi> the ſecond ioined it to the Empire: for at the beginning it was a popular eſtate. One onely ciuill diſcord in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, changed it into an <hi>Aristocratia,</hi> or gouernment of a few principall perſons: by which meanes the whole authoritie came into the hands of the Senatours; who euer ſince haue vſed ſuch equitie and moderation in their gouernment, as there hath not at any time in ſo great a multitude of common people, and diuerſitie of nations, growen any notable ſedition or pernitious mutinie. In the citie there are three degrees of people, that is to ſay, Senatours, Merchants, and Artizans. Ancient and honourable families there are 28. out of which alwayes are ſupplied new Senatours: who all of them are ſix and twentie in number. Thirteene of theſe, called Burgomaſters, doe conſult of matters of Eſtate: and the other thirteene they call Scabins, who being alwayes aſsiſted by three ſtipendarie lawyers, doe vpon Court and Leet dayes execute iuſtice and decide controuerſies among the citizens. It is forbidden by their ancient lawes,<note place="margin">S.W. Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</note> that any profeſſed lawyer, or any that beares the title of a Doctour, ſhould be admitted to their ſenate, or to the gouernment of their Common wealth. Out of either of the ſaid halfes or thirteenes they chuſe euery Lunar moneth or new moone a new Conſull; ſo that euery yeere the chiefe magiſtracie falles by turnes for the ſpace of a moneth to euery man of both the foreſaid thirteenes. Fiue there are of the ſame company, that in criminall cauſes do make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, giue ſentence, and allot puniſhment to malefactours. They haue likewiſe a Iudge or Preſident for their ſuburbs, who executes iuſtice among the peſants and villageois. Out of the ſame company alſo, they yerely elect two Treaſurers, men of ſufficient yeeres, credit, and honeſty, who take charge of the cuſtomes and reuenues of the whole citie, and haue the receit and disburſing of the ſame. All the ſaid magiſtrates, and others that haue any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, are choſen only out of the foreſaid number of Senatours. Two hundred there are yeerely nominated out of the three Eſtates and the whole citie, who once a yeere, or vpon any vrgent occaſion, being aſſembled by the magiſtrates, do ſit in common counſell. The State or company of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, albeit very great and honourable, are freed notwithſtanding from all publike offices, and endowed with moſt ample priuileges: wherefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their priuate traffike, they do in this citie, as in a common ware-houſe, hoord vp the riches not only of <hi>Europe,</hi> but of the moſt remote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and iſlands in the world. The labourers and artizans, which are the laſt and meaneſt degree, are ſuffered to haue no conuenticles nor meetings priuate or publike in the citie; no ſolemne banquets nor feſtiuall aſſemblies of many together, vnleſſe it be for a matter of religion or ſome great fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: for they hold it a thing pernicious to the publike tranquillitie, hauing found by often experience, that moſt dangerous factions and ſeditions haue growen of ſuch popular meetings, where people in their drunkenneſſe diſpute of the Common-wealth: and that the like tumults haue bereft many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their libertie, and brought great calamities vpon them. Now if any quarrell or diſſention ariſe among the common ſort, it is not referred to the Maſters or Wardens of their crafts and myſteries, but to the Senatours themſelues; who preſently appoint two arbitratours, to ſearch into the cauſe, and to do their beſt to compound it. If they can not bring it to agreement, then it comes before the Senate; who hauing awarded the matter, do vnder a grieuous penaltie impoſe ſilence to both parties. With great ſeueritie they puniſh fightings, brawles, iniuries, and priuate quarrels, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of publike peace: inſomuch as a man would thinke, that <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> gaue dayly ſentence vpon their iudgement ſeats. Thus farre <hi>Pighius</hi> concerning the originall, the magiſtrates, and the common wealth of this citie. More you may reade in the ſame authour. The territories ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iacent being naturally barren and ſandie are by the induſtrie of the people made fruitfull. In the ſame territorie ſtands <hi>Altorff,</hi> where not many yeeres ſince the States of <hi>Nurenburg</hi> inſtituted an Vniuerſitie. <hi>Nurenburg</hi> is watered by the riuer <hi>Pegnitz,</hi> which it croſſeth with many ſtone-bridges. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it containeth eight miles. It is compaſſed with a double wall, whereon are 183. turrets, beſides caſtles and fortreſſes. Concerning the originall, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, maners and cuſtomes of this citie, you haue a notable diſcourſe written by <hi>Conradus Celtis</hi> a Poet laureat.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Oannes Dubrauius</hi> in his Bohemian ſtory deſcribeth this region in maner following. <hi>Bohemia</hi> is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in <hi>Germanie.</hi> Eaſt it extendeth to <hi>Morauia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and weſt to <hi>Bauaria. Auſtria</hi> bordereth to the South, as <hi>Saxonie</hi> and <hi>Miſnia</hi> do Northward. It is in forme of a <hi>Theater</hi> enuironed around by the foreſt or woods of <hi>Hercynia.</hi> Wherefore there is no great difference between the length and the bredth, containing not much aboue 200. miles a piece. <hi>Charles</hi> king of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who afterward was Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, diuided it into 12. regions, of which one only he named after the riuer <hi>Vultaw</hi> that runneth through <hi>Prage:</hi> the other eleuen he called by the names of their principall townes; ſome of them being ſo harſh of pronunciation, that a man ſhall hardly ſpeake them, vnleſſe he be a Bohemian borne or very skilfull in the language. The chiefe Bohemian townes lying towards <hi>Morauia</hi> are <hi>Mutha, Chrudima, Konignigretz, Pardubitz, Litomitz.</hi> Towards <hi>Bauaria</hi> you haue <hi>Glatow, Domazlitz, Miſa</hi> and <hi>Tachow.</hi> On the ſide towards <hi>Auſtria</hi> the principall towne is <hi>Buduitz,</hi> with <hi>Cromlawe, Trebon, Hradeck:</hi> as likewiſe on the <hi>Miſnian</hi> ſide ſtand <hi>Pons, Cadana, Chomutawe, Auſtia:</hi> and on the Sileſian quarter <hi>Iaromir, Glacitz, Curia,</hi> and ſome others. In the heart of the countrey the principall townes of note are <hi>Cuttenberg, Kolim, Pelſin, Veron, Zateckz, Launa, Slana, Lytomerick,</hi> and <hi>Tabor.</hi> But the head citie of all is <hi>Prage,</hi> being ſo great, as it containeth three faire cities within it, namely, the new, the old, and the little towne, which is diſioyned from the two former by the riuer <hi>Vultaw.</hi> Their Buildings both Publique and priuat are ſtately and magnificall. This city hath two caſtles; one called <hi>Viſſegard,</hi> whilom the Kings palace, but now waſte and almoſt deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, by meanes of ciuile warres. Again that other caſtle that ouer looketh the little towne, as it is named, ſo it well deſerueth the title of the Royal or princely caſtle. For it reſembleth rather a city then a Caſtle; filling vp ſo great a roome with the wals and buildings. Of publique edifices, the Church built by King <hi>Charles</hi> before mentioned; and the Caſtle erected by K. <hi>Vladiſlaus,</hi> late deceaſed, are the moſt memorable. And as <hi>Prage</hi> of all their Cities hath the preeminence; ſo hath <hi>Elbe</hi> (called by Tacitus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed and famous) of all their riuers. Howbeit concerning the fountaine of this riuer Tacitus writeth skarce ſoundly, namely that it ſpringeth in the region of the <hi>Hermonduri.</hi> For it ariſeth not among the <hi>Hermonduri,</hi> but rather out of certaine Bohemian mountaines lying open to the North, vpon the frontiers of <hi>Morauia,</hi> which the ancient Bohemians call <hi>Cerconeſsi.</hi> From which mountaines this riuer refreſheth and watereth the greater and better part of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and then hauing augmented his ſtreames by the influence of <hi>Vultawa, Egra, Satzawa, Gitzera,</hi> and <hi>Miſa</hi> his neighbour-riuers, continueth his courſe and name through <hi>Miſnia</hi> and <hi>Saxonie</hi> to the maine Ocean, being all that way enriched with abundance of Salmons. But the ſmaller riuers and freſhets of <hi>Bohemia</hi> yeeld in ſome places graines of gold, and in others ſhell-fiſhes containing pearle. Heere alſo you haue certaine hot bathes both pleaſant and medicinable. And all the whole countrie ſo aboundeth with graine, as it affoordeth plenty to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-regions. Wines there are no great ſtore: and thoſe of the countrey ſo weake, as they laſt but a very ſmall time. Howbeit they haue ſaffron of the beſt, excelling both in colour, ſmell, and moiſture, three principall properties to chuſe that commoditie by. There are ſiluer-mines ſo exceeding rich, that were it not for ſome ſmall quantitie of flint that inſinuates it ſelfe into the veine, you ſhould haue nothing but perfect ſiluer: whereas in other countries thoſe mines are eſteemed of high price, that hold a quarter or a fift part, or at the vtmoſt one halfe of good ſiluer. They find alſo plenty of gold-ore in certaine mines which take their name of a place called <hi>Giloua.</hi> It is reported that the Kings of <hi>Bohemia</hi> haue had graines of pure gold brought from thence weighing tenne pound a piece. Neither are they deſtitute of baſer metall: namely, tinne, lead, copper, and yron. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they finde in thoſe mineral rockes, the carbuncle, the Saphyre, and the Amethiſt. Next vnto their mines there is nothing of greater account to the Bohemians then their waters repleniſhed with carps: which I haue declared more at large in a peculiar booke treating of fiſh-pondes. Now let vs decypher the diſpoſition of the inhabitants. In briefe therefore, both in maners, habit, and ſtature of body the Bohemians reſemble the Lion king of beaſts, vnder whoſe conſtillation they are ſubiect; that is to ſay, if you conſider either the largeneſſe of their limbs, their broad and mightie breaſtes, their yellow ſhag-haire hanging ouer their ſhoulders, the harſhneſſe of their voice, their ſparkling eies, or their exceeding ſtrength and courage. The Lion carries a kind of contempt and diſdainefull pride ouer other beaſtes, and hardly ſhall you vanquiſh him, if you aſſaile him by force. Neither doth the Bohemian in this reſpect degenerate but ſoone ſhewes his contempt towards other nations both in word and deed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers his arrogancie both in his gate, geſture, and pompe. Being ſet light by, he growes impatient; in any enterprize he is as bold as a Lion, and moſt firme and conſtant till he hath brought it to execution, but not without a touch of ambition and vaine glory. Moreouer like a lion he is greedie of his meat, and very curious in the dreſſing and ſeaſoning thereof. And their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Saxons</hi> haue taught them to carouſe both day and night. And by reaſon of their neighbourhood the Bohemians differ not much from the Germans in other qualities. Hitherto <hi>Dubrauius,</hi> by whom alſo the originall and ancient dwelling place of this nation is deſcribed. They brew excellent ale in this countrey, calling it Whiteale. They ſpeake the Sclauon tongue, calling themſelues <hi>Czecks,</hi> and the Germans <hi>Niemecks.</hi> Vnder the ſtile of this kingdome are alſo comprized the regions of <hi>Morauia, Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Luſatia.</hi> Likewiſe in the yeare 1315. the city <hi>Egra</hi> became the warehouſe or principall mart towne of the Bohemians. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the region it ſelfe you may read more largely in <hi>Aeneas Siluius;</hi> and of the people, in the firſt booke of <hi>Martinus Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus</hi> his Polonian ſtory. Vnto theſe you may adde <hi>Munſter, Rithaimer, Crantzius</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Wandalia,</hi> and <hi>Sabellicus En.</hi> 10. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Panthaleon Candidus</hi> wrote of late ſeuen books entitled <hi>Bohemaidos. Prage</hi> the head citie of this Kindome, is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly deſcribed by <hi>Georgius Handſchius.</hi> The Map it ſelfe we borowed out of the Table of <hi>Ioannes Crigingerus,</hi> publiſhed at <hi>Prage</hi> 1568.</p>
            <p>The diuers appellations of certaine cities in this Kingdome we thought good here to put downe out of <hi>Munſter.</hi> For the names of all their cities, are by the Bohemian pronounced after one maner, and by the German after another.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>Ohn Crato</hi> one of the Emperours counſellers, and his principall Phyſician, hath for the benefit of the ſtudious in Geography, out of his relations of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> imparted thus much vnto vs.</p>
            <p>That we may not be ſcrupulous about the name of the Sileſians, nor (as ſome haue done) deriue it from the Elyſian fields: we are out of ancient writers to vnderſtand, that the ſame region which they now poſſeſſe, was formerly inhabited by the Quadi. For <hi>Quad</hi> in the Saxon or old German tongue, hath the ſame ſignification that <hi>Siletz</hi> hath in the Polonian or Sclauon. For they were a people that reſorted hither out of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places, more addicted to warre than peace, deſtroyers rather than builders, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of all ſuperioritie. The firſt King that bare rule ouer them was <hi>Boleſlaus</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacke. He was borne in the yeere of our Lord 967. his mother a Bohemian, neece to Duke <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> by the brothers ſide. A ſonne of his called <hi>Mieſlaus,</hi> in the yeere 1001. was married to <hi>Rixa</hi> daughter of <hi>Erenfrid</hi> County Palantine, neece to the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the third, by his ſiſter <hi>Melchitis:</hi> and this man was the firſt that receiued the kingly diademe from <hi>Otho</hi> the third. But after his deceaſe the Polonians hauing by ſedition expelled out of their kingdome the Emperours niece and his ſonne <hi>Caſimire, Conradus</hi> the Emperour reſeruing to himſelfe a certaine tribute, annexed <hi>Sileſia</hi> to the crowne of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> This Emperour was an Vratiſlauian borne, and perhaps gaue the name of <hi>Vratiſlauia</hi> to his natiue citie, which is now commonly called <hi>Breſlaw.</hi> But hereof I cannot certainly affirme ought. This one thing is not to be doubted, that the Sileſians had no affection towards the Polonians, whenas by the practiſe and induſtry of <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt king of <hi>Bohemia</hi> father to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, they vnited themſelues to the Bohemians. Some there are (by what authority or opinion I know not) which affirme that in the ſame place where <hi>Breſlaw</hi> now ſtands, was built in times paſt by a Prince called <hi>Liguis,</hi> the city of <hi>Budurgis</hi> mentioned in <hi>Ptolemey.</hi> For it is apparent out of hiſtories, that <hi>Mieſlaus</hi> Duke of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was firſt created King by the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the third, and in the yeere 965. embraced Chriſtianitie, did <hi>anno</hi> 1048. erect a woodden church or chapel to the honour of <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> Whereby you may gather, that in thoſe dayes there was no great matter of building at <hi>Breſlaw.</hi> Moreouer, <hi>Gotefridus</hi> the firſt Prelate of that church being an Italian, preferred the village of <hi>Smogra</hi> before the citie of <hi>Breſlaw,</hi> hauing there his Schole and College. Likewiſe about this time it is thought that the foundations of other the principall cities of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> namely of <hi>Lignitz, Glogaw, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi> &amp;c. were layd: for out of monuments and Annales no certainty can be gathered, whenas the ancienteſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in all <hi>Sileſia</hi> are the letters of the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, which were written in the yeere 1200. all the reſidue being conſumed and loſt, either by fires or inuaſions which haue beene very terrible in theſe parts. But by the good indeuour of <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa, Sileſia</hi> was both pacified, and ſo diſtributed among the ſonnes of <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> king of <hi>Poland,</hi> that it ſeemed not altogether to be diſmembred from that crowne. But when the Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans perceiued that <hi>Sileſia</hi> grew full of Germans, and that the Princes began to fauour them; reiecting the lawfull heires, they aduanced to the kingdome of <hi>Sileſia</hi> one <hi>Vladiſlaus Locticus,</hi> a cruell enemy to the Germans. This was the occaſion that they betooke themſelues to the protection of <hi>Iohn</hi> king of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> who being ſonne to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth, married the daughter of <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> king of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and was inueſted into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome 1302. Wherefore after the deceaſe of this <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Lucelberg, Sileſia</hi> was ſubiect to twelue Bohemian kings one after another, ſix whereof were Emperours, one a Bohemian, another an Hungarian, fiue of the houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> two Polacks, but deſcended from <hi>Austria</hi> by the mothers ſide. Of the Polonian race remained as yet in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia</hi> the Princes of <hi>Lignitz</hi> and <hi>Teſchnitz:</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Munſterberg</hi> deriue their pedegree from <hi>George</hi> king of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia. Vratiſlauia</hi> the head-city of <hi>Sileſia</hi> being burnt to aſhes in the yere 1341, began then ſo ſtately to be built of ſtone, as at this preſent both for order and beauty of houſes and largeneſſe of ſtreets, it is little inferiour to any of the cities in <hi>Germanie.</hi> Concerning other more true ornaments of a Common-wealth, I ſhall not need to ſpeake, ſeeing it is manifeſt to all <hi>Germanie,</hi> that ſcarſe in any other region there are to be found ſo many Schooles, ſuch numbers of learned Profeſſours, and of excellent wits. It beſeemes me not to ſpeake too gloriouſly of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen; yet thus much I may boldly ſay, that there is almoſt no Princes court, nor any famous common-wealth, where the vertue and learning of the Sileſians findes not entertainment. The gentlemen likewiſe albeit addicted to tillage and good husbandry, yet are they ſo warlike withall, that no indifferent Iudges can deny, but that by their valour the remainder of <hi>Hungarie</hi> is defended. It is a region very fruitfull of corne, eſpecially in one place aboue the reſt, which is moſt carefully manured by our people. It aboundeth with fiſh-pooles. The famous riuer <hi>Odera</hi> confineth it Eaſt and North, and South it is diuided from <hi>Bohemia</hi> by <hi>Sudetes.</hi> But the ſituation beſt appeareth in the Map. Of <hi>Sileſia</hi> you haue ſomewhat written by <hi>Aeneas Syluius,</hi> and by others which are ignorant of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. But <hi>Laurentius Coruinus</hi> could haue brought more certainties to light, had not the age wherein he liued been fatally ouerwhelmed in ignorance. Thus much <hi>Iohn Crato</hi> concerning his natiue countrey <hi>Sileſia.</hi> It containeth twelue Dukedomes; one Biſhoprick, the Biſhop whereof hath his reſidence at <hi>Neiſſe,</hi> and ſometimes at <hi>Breſlaw:</hi> for there is a Cathedrall church and a College of Canons. Heere are foure Baronies alſo. In this region about <hi>Striga</hi> and <hi>Lignitz</hi> is found a kinde of medicinable earth, commonly called <hi>Terra ſigillata,</hi> like that of <hi>Lemnus,</hi> and of equall force; ſome quantitie whereof <hi>Iacobus Manouius</hi> Citizen and Senatour of <hi>Breſlaw</hi> hath often beſtowed vpon me.</p>
            <p>The Chronicles of <hi>Sileſia</hi> were of late written by <hi>Ioachimus Curius,</hi> wherein he hath ſo curiouſly deſcribed the ſituation and the antiquity of their townes and cities, the gouernment of their ſtate, and their memorable acts, that the ſtudious may here finde an abſolute hiſtory. I am informed by <hi>Iacobus Monauius,</hi> that <hi>Francis Faber</hi> hath deſcribed it in verſe alſo.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ORAVIA is thus deſcribed by <hi>Ioannes Dubrauius</hi> in his Bohemian ſtory: <hi>Morauia</hi> was called of olde <hi>Marcomania,</hi> becauſe it confined vpon <hi>Germany</hi> at that place, where <hi>Dariubius</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth <hi>Hungary.</hi> For <hi>Mark</hi> in high Dutch ſignifies a limit or confine, and thereupon <hi>Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni</hi> are ſuch as inhabit the borders of a countrey. Concerning theſe people <hi>Arrianus</hi> in his relation of <hi>Germany,</hi> the fartheſt of theſe nations (ſaith he) are the <hi>Quadi</hi> and <hi>Marcomanni,</hi> then the Iazyges a people of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> after the Getes, and laſtly a great part of the Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Howbeit, at this preſent, becauſe it is bounded by the riuer <hi>Mora,</hi> from the ſame riuer the inhabitants are called <hi>Moraui,</hi> and the countrey <hi>Morauia.</hi> On three ſides, as it now ſtands, it is diuided by mountaines, woods, foreſts, or riuers; on the Eaſt from <hi>Hungary,</hi> Weſt from <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and North from <hi>Sileſia:</hi> for on the South part towards <hi>Auſtria</hi> it is plaine, being ſome where ſeparated therefrom by the riuer <hi>Thayſa,</hi> and in other places by another obſcure riuer. The principall riuer in <hi>Morauia</hi> is <hi>Mora,</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironeth the chiefe city called <hi>Olmuntz,</hi> and from thence running into <hi>Hungary,</hi> diſchargeth himſelfe with his tributary ſtreames into the chanell of <hi>Danubius.</hi> For <hi>Mora</hi> receiuing into his boſome the riuer <hi>Nigra;</hi> and that of <hi>Switta,</hi> whereon ſtandeth the city <hi>Brin</hi> next in dignity to <hi>Olmuntz;</hi> alſo <hi>Thayſa,</hi> which glideth along by the city <hi>Znaim</hi> famous for the death of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour; and laſtly <hi>Igla</hi> paſsing by the city <hi>Igla;</hi> rendreth vp his owne and his neighbours ſubſtance to the great and renowmed <hi>Danubius.</hi> But the riuer <hi>Odera</hi> ſpringing not far from <hi>Olmuntz,</hi> retaineth his name to the Ocean ſea. Some thinke it is called by <hi>Ptolemey Viadrus. Odera</hi> is ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of a word borrowed from fowlers, which call their watch-towers for the ſpying and taking of birds, <hi>Odri;</hi> and ſuch towers you haue now in <hi>Morauia</hi> at the fountaine of <hi>Odera.</hi> Neither muſt we heere omit the riuer <hi>Hana,</hi> which albeit ſometimes ſcant of water, yet doth it ſo moiſten the neighbour-fields, being thereby the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſt in all the region, as the husbandmen in regard of their plentifull increaſe, call them the fat of <hi>Morauia.</hi> Here alſo more than in other places are found the ſiluer and gold coines of <hi>M. Antoninus,</hi> of <hi>Commodus,</hi> and other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. Which is a manifeſt argument of ancient warres betweene the forces of the Empire and the Marco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>This one thing is moſt worthy the admiration, that in <hi>Morauia</hi> there is a kind of Frankincenſe &amp; Myrrhe, not diſtilling out of trees as in other countries, but digged from vnder the ground, in one place only called <hi>Gradiſco,</hi> where till this preſent is found not only Frankincenſe called Male frankincenſe in regard of the reſemblance it hath with the priuie parts of man; but alſo in the ſhape of other members both of man and woman. And of late <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> of the noble family ſurnamed <hi>à Quercu,</hi> as he was making a foundation for the banke of a fiſh-poole in his field of <hi>Sterenberg,</hi> he found the intire body of a man, conſiſting all of Myrrhe, the which diſtributing vnto his friends, and remembring me among the reſt, beſtowed on me more than halfe an arme, which I vſed often for a perfume.</p>
            <p>The inner part of the region is arable, an exceeding fertile and fat ſoile, and moſt apt for corne: as the hilles for vines, being more fauourable to <hi>Bacchus</hi> than the hilles of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> wherefore it excelleth for abundance of good wine. And it is ſo generally manured, and hath ſuch plentie of husbandmen, that vnleſſe it be in foreſts and deſert places, heere is no paſture at all for the feeding of cattell. For the reſt, both in ſpeech, faſhions and cuſtomes, they are like the Bohemians. Hitherto <hi>Dubrauius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the yeere 895. the people of this region were inſtructed in the Chriſtian faith by <hi>S. Methodius,</hi> at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of <hi>Arnulphus</hi> the Emperour. Vnder the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, in the yeere 1086. this countrey, together with <hi>Luſatia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> was annexed to the kingdome of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Their language is mixt, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part ſpeake Bohemian, and the high Dutch is vſed only in cities among perſons of beſt account. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince (as <hi>Dubrauius</hi> writeth) yeelds plentie of wine, but not of the ſtrongeſt; ſuch (ſaith <hi>Rithaimerus,</hi> and I my ſelfe haue ſo found it by experience) as exempteth not the drinker quite from care. <hi>Dugloſſus</hi> in his Polonian ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſaith that the name of the riuer <hi>Odera</hi> ſignifies in the Henetian tongue, inundation or robbery. <hi>Olmuntz</hi> the head citie of this region, and the ſeat of a Biſhop, is deſcribed by <hi>Stephanus Taurinus</hi> in his <hi>Stauromachia.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Morauia,</hi> beſides <hi>Dubrauius,</hi> reade <hi>Aeneas Siluius</hi> in his Bohemian ſtory.</p>
            <p>This Map of <hi>Morauia</hi> firſt drawen by <hi>Fabricius,</hi> but afterward corrected by diuers gentlemen of the countrey was ſent me by <hi>Iohn Crato</hi> Counſeller and principall Phyſician to the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the ſecond a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fauourer of theſe my ſtudies. He gaue me alſo this catalogue of townes called both by German and Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian names.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>EORGE RITHAYMER, in his Abridgement of the ſituation of the world, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth <hi>Auſtrich</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Pannony</hi> the higher, in theſe words: <hi>Pannony</hi> the higher (ſaith he) toward the Eaſt abbutteth vpon the riuer <hi>Leyth. Ptolemey</hi> maketh the riuer <hi>Rab</hi> his Eaſtern bound. Vpon the Weſt it is bounded with the riuer <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſus,</hi> and <hi>Noricum</hi> which is a part of <hi>Bayern.</hi> Some do on that coaſt limit it with the mountaine <hi>Caetius:</hi> on the North with the riuer <hi>Tey</hi> and the countrey <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia:</hi> for ſo farre at this day it doth extend it ſelfe on that ſide. Vpon the South coaſt it reſteth vpon the mountaines of <hi>Steyri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſoile is good and fertile of all maner of corne, and is ſuch as is manured and tilled with ſmall charge. In that part which is beyond <hi>Donaw</hi> and is called <hi>Marchfield,</hi> where long ſince the <hi>Chetuari</hi> and and <hi>Parmecampi</hi> were ſeated, the husbandman falloweth his land with one poore ſeely jade only. Marle, without which their land in <hi>Bayern</hi> is leane and barren, what it meaneth the husbandmen of <hi>Auſtrich</hi> know not. It beareth ſo good Saffron, as no other in the world may compare with it. It affoordeth Wine paſsing holeſome and agreeable to the nature of man. <hi>Althamerus</hi> vpon <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> his <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania</hi> writeth that it yeeldeth plentie of Ginger in a mountaine neere the towne <hi>Hamburg</hi> in the middeſt of <hi>Auſtrich</hi> or <hi>Pannony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath many ancient and famous cities: notwithſtanding thoſe of greateſt note are <hi>Styre, Vadenhoff, Melck, Caſtell,</hi> anciently called <hi>Claudionum, Crembs, Cetro</hi> caſtle now called <hi>Zeiſſelmaur, Saint Hippolytus,</hi> the two <hi>Newberies,</hi> one ſurnamed of the Abbey, the other of Corne. <hi>Petronell</hi> a village now, but in old time a great citie, as his foundation, ruines, and heaps of ſtones and rubbiſh do teſtifie. The new city <hi>Pruck</hi> vpon the banke of the riuer <hi>Leyth</hi> and <hi>Hamburg:</hi> out of all the moſt famous is <hi>VVien</hi> ſometime called <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiana</hi> and <hi>Iuliobona,</hi> renowmed for the Vniuerſitie and Schoole, than which there is none that hath brought forth more excellent and greater Mathematicians. This citie is round beſet with Vineyards. The houſes of the citizens are ſtately and beautifull, ſo that they may ſeeme to giue entertainment to Princes, and are built with large and open windowes to let the aire in and out: and therefore they are neuer peſtered and offended with cloſe and bad aire; for that euery priuate houſe hath either his ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall court-yard or back-ſide. Hither is great concourſe of forren nations from all countreys of <hi>Europe.</hi> Here is great plentie of all maner of prouiſion neceſſary for the maintenance of mans life.</p>
            <p>The riuers of <hi>Auſtrich</hi> are <hi>Donaw,</hi> ſometime the vtmoſt border of the region, but now it runneth thorow the midſt of the ſame; <hi>Onaſus, Drawn, Erlaph,</hi> which at <hi>Cella</hi> (or <hi>Zelltal,</hi> famous for the Church of the Virgine <hi>Marie</hi>) ariſeth out of a moſt pleaſant lake: <hi>Draiſn, Ypſie, Melck, Marck.</hi> Theſe doe ſeuer <hi>Morauia</hi> from <hi>Auſtrich: Camb</hi> a notable riuer for ſundry ſorts of fiſh: <hi>Leytte,</hi> and <hi>Swegad</hi> in which are Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhes or Crabs of a moſt pleaſant taſte. Thus farre <hi>Rithaymer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the originall and reaſon of the etymologie of the name of this countrey, this report <hi>Lazius</hi> in his Commentaries of <hi>VVien</hi> doth giue. The name of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> (ſaith he) was inuented of late, about foure hundred yeeres ſince, of the blaſt of the South winde called of the Latines <hi>Auster,</hi> which winde in this country bloweth oft: or of the ſimilitude of the German name; (which I thinke to be more likely) for the Kings of the Franks called the Eaſt border of their Kingdomes <hi>Oſtenrich,</hi> like as the Weſt part they termed <hi>Weſtenrich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This region long ſince was firſt gouerned by Marqueſſes, then by Dukes; and laſtly by Archdukes; to whom it is now ſubiect: as is more at large to be ſeene in the ſaid Commentaries of <hi>Lazius.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient armes of this countrey were fiue Larkes Ore, in a field Azure: but <hi>Lupold</hi> the Marqueſſe, the fift of that name, of an accident or euent that befell him, was licenced by the Emperour to alter his coat, and to beare a field Gules with a feſſe argent: for that in the ſiege and aſſault of <hi>Accon</hi> he was all ouer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with bloud, onely his girdle excepted. More thou maieſt reade of this in <hi>Munster</hi> and <hi>Cuſpinian.</hi> The deſcription of <hi>Auſtrich</hi> is to be ſeene in <hi>Bonfinius</hi> in the end of his fourth booke fourth Decade of his hiſtorie of <hi>Hungarie. Pius</hi> the ſecond in his deſcription of <hi>Europe</hi> citeth an hiſtorie of his, written of this countrey: which notwithſtanding as yet it was neuer our chance to ſee. The ſame authour hath in his Epiſtles paſsing well deſcribed <hi>Vienna</hi> or <hi>VVien,</hi> the chiefe citie of this Prouince.</p>

The Fennes yeeld paſtures; the Mountaines hawking and hunting. But this citie hauing long ſince flouriſhed for a few yeres, in the time of <hi>Attila</hi> the King of the Hunnes, ſuſteined many inrodes and incurſions, and was miſerably waſted with fire and ſword. Afterward about the yeere of Chriſt 520, whenas <hi>S.

Peter.</hi> Alſo by the bountifull magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the ſame Duke, he erected a Monaſterie of the order of <hi>S. Bennet,</hi> and gouerned the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſea foure and fortie yeeres &amp;c. The ſame authour in that place reckoneth vp alſo the reſt of the Biſhops and Archbiſhops of this ſea.

            <p>This countrey generally is reaſonably fertile: as of Salt, Corne, Cattell, Fiſh, Woods, Birds, Paſtures, Deere, and of all ſuch things neceſſarily required to the maintenance of mans life, either for apparell or victuall, it is ſufficiently ſtored.

And although that <hi>Noremberg</hi> be no ancient citie, yet his caſtle, ſituate vpon the toppe of an hill, is very ancient. This region hath many townes, monaſteries and villages, eſpecially <hi>Amberg,</hi> which in the yeere of Chriſt 1300. was encloſed with a wall. <hi>Awerbach, Sultzpach, Caſtell Munſter,</hi> (where in old time the Princes of <hi>Nortgoia</hi> haue held their Court) <hi>Eger, Beierut, Eister, Napurg, Newenſtadt, Rewenkelm, Kemnat, Kruſen, Greuenwerdt, Eſchenbach, VVeiden, Pernaw, Pleiſtein, Herſpruck, Rurbach, Neumarckt, Turſenrut, Elbogen, Cham, Schonſee, Kunſperg, Stauff, &amp;c.</hi> Which for the moſt part do belong vnto the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Princes.

Otherwiſe the ſoile is hard and rough, although in ſome places it doth bring forth good ſtore of graine, and is excellent paſture ground. This Prouince of <hi>Nortgoia</hi> conteineth one of the foure Earledomes or Landtgrauies, which long ſince were erected by the Emperors, namely, <hi>Luchtenberg,</hi> which taketh his name of the caſtle <hi>Luchtenberg,</hi> notwithſtanding that the Princes of that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction doe keepe their Court in the towne of <hi>Freimbd,</hi> and ſometime in <hi>Grunſfelden,</hi> the ſituation of which towne thou mayeſt ſee in the Mappe.

On the Eaſt it bordereth vpon the <hi>Sueui, Vindelici</hi> and <hi>Norici:</hi> On the Weſt vpon the Countie Palatine of <hi>Rhein,</hi> the Prince Electour, and Marqueſſe of <hi>Baden:</hi> laſtly it comprehendeth the mountaines of <hi>Swartz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald,</hi> the Blacke-wood. On the South the mountaines of <hi>Arbon</hi> and the Alpes of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (ſo the inhabitants do call the higher mountaines of that countrey) do ioyntly ouerlooke it. On the North they haue the Franckes their neighbours, and not farre off alſo, is <hi>Othos</hi> wood. And therefore the iuriſdiction of <hi>VVirtemberg</hi> can not more fitly take his begginning, than where <hi>Nicher</hi> ariſeth, which ſpringeth from a ſmall fountaine out of the high hilles of <hi>Arbona</hi> in the Dukedome of <hi>VVirtemberg,</hi> neere vnto the villages <hi>Schwenningen,</hi> in the confines of the towne <hi>Villing,</hi> not much more than fiue hundred paſes from the fountaine of <hi>Donaw.</hi> Not farre from his fountaine it paſſeth by <hi>Rotwell,</hi> and leauing vpon the left hand the head of <hi>Blacke-wood,</hi> vpon the right, <hi>Switzerland</hi> Alpes, runneth by the Duchie of <hi>VVirtemberg</hi> with a wandering and crooked courſe (ſo ſaluting here and there certaine noble mens caſtles, and townes of the Roman Emperours) from his firſt riſe the ſpace of fiue dayes iourney more or leſſe, being with diuers little ſtreames from ſundry places encreaſed and laden, and ſo made nauigable, at <hi>Heydelberg</hi> falleth very ſwiftly into the <hi>Rhein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole countrey, by reaſon of the nature of the ſoile, whether for tillage or otherwiſe in reſpect of the fertility, is not euery where alike. For that part where <hi>Nicher</hi> ariſeth, and which bordereth vpon the <hi>Blacke-wood,</hi> as alſo that which is abbuttant vpon the Alpes of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> (ſituate betweene <hi>Donaw</hi> and <hi>Nicher</hi>) is ſomewhat rough, vnapt for vines, but yeelding indifferent good paſture for cattell. The ſoile within the Alps is ſtony, yet very good for corne: in like maner by the ſides of <hi>Blacke-wood,</hi> the land is ſandy of a red colour, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is reaſonable good corne ground. Euery where the nation is much giuen to breed and bring vp cattell. Nere vnto the foreſt of <hi>Blacke-wood</hi> there are recorded to be theſe Lordſhips, ſubiect vnto the Duchy of <hi>VVirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg: Hornberg, Schultach, Dornſtad, Nagold, VVildberg, Kalbe, VVilde bath, Newenſtade.</hi> By the Alps, or neere vnto them, theſe Lordſhips, <hi>Baling, VVrach, Blawbeyren, Heidenheim, Tuthing</hi> vpon the banke of <hi>Donaw,</hi> by the which, as by a certaine trench, they are ſeuered and diuided. But euery where the confines of the iuriſdiction of <hi>VVirtemberg</hi> do gather themſelues into a ring, as it were, encloſed with a large band, to the places neere to <hi>Nicher.</hi> But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Nicher</hi> doth ſpread it ſelfe into the champian fields, there it is not only more kinde for temperature of the aire, but alſo the ſoile is more fit for tillage. Euery where are riuers well ſtored with fiſh, holeſome ſprings, pleaſant lakes, goodly valleys. Euery where hilles beſet with Vines, well-graſing paſtures and medowes, fertile fields, foreſts of woods and groues, in the which are great ſtore of Beeches, many Okes, innumerable companies of Deeres, large paſtures, abundance of cattell: in all places plenty of Wine, Corne and Apples.</p>
            <p>Vpon the brinke of crooked <hi>Nicher,</hi> here and there, are many goodly cities; ſome of them of reaſonable greatneſſe, others not ſo bigge; but for building and beautie very glorious.

Moreouer, generally the people of this countrey is for their manhood, humanitie, conſtancie and religion very renowmed. The townes (as I ſaid before) are not ſo great, but are ſumptuouſly built; whereof ſome are ſufficiently fortified by nature and benefit of the place; other ſome by the induſtrie and labour of man. The villages are ſo well inhabited, that they are not much inferiour to prety townes: their houſes are of timber, but very artificially built. The caſtles are fortified by nature and ſituation, as alſo by the ingenious arte of fortification, and ſo are not eaſie to be ſurpriſed: ſo that a man would thinke that another <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> were yet extant amongſt the Switzers; ſuch is the excellencie of the men both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>This Dukedome hath his name of <hi>VVirtemberg</hi> an ancient beacon, which now is ſituate in the midſt of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, not very farre from <hi>Stutgard,</hi> yet vpon ſomewhat a riſing ground &amp; hilly place, is neither for his ſtrength nor building any terrour to the enemy. But according to the cuſtome of their anceſtours, who truſted rather to their ſwords of ſteele, than walles of ſtone, it was notable for the pleaſantneſſe of the place, only commendable now for his antiquitie, hauing a moſt goodly proſpect round about; aboue are the woods of Beech, beneath are the fertile hilles of Vines &amp;c. The late Dukes of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> for many ages paſt, held their Court in this tower, taking from thence their name, their ſtocke, and their armes, as is to euery man very apparent. There are which thinke, that the Dukes of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> haue had their ofſpring from the Tuſcans or Rhaetians: others from the French. Whether of theſe opinions are more probable, I much regard not, for in a thing altogether vncertaine I affirme nothing conſtantly. It is certaine that they were ſtrangers: whether they came firſt forth of <hi>Italie</hi> or from <hi>France,</hi> that as yet is not certainly knowen, &amp;c. Thus farre <hi>Iohn Pede.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey which diuided the Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> into certeine Bands or Circles (<hi>Kreis</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call them) they made <hi>Switzerland</hi> the fourth in order, now in all they record tenne: it is certaine, as approued hiſtories do mention, that at firſt <hi>Switzerland</hi> was a Kingdome, but afterward reduced vnto a Dukedome. Notwithſtanding at this day there is none of the Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> which is graced with the title of Duke of <hi>Switzerland:</hi> for it is now diuided amongſt many Princes. One part hath accrued by lot of inheritance vnto the houſe of <hi>Auſtrich:</hi> the duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> enioyeth the greateſt part: in it there are many free cities, and ſuch as do belong vnto the crowne of the Empire: many are ſubiect vnto the Duke of <hi>Bauiere.</hi> There is none of the old writers which doth not make report of this Nation, as of the moſt noble and ancienteſt of all <hi>Germany.</hi> It is cleere out of <hi>Ptolemey, Strabo,</hi> and other authours, that heretofore they were ſeated vpon the riuer <hi>Sweue</hi> and <hi>Albis.</hi> But now at this day it is the vtmoſt prouince of all <hi>Germany,</hi> for it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butteth vpon the Alpes. It is bounded by <hi>Bayern, Frankenland</hi> and <hi>Alſatia</hi> or <hi>Elſas,</hi> on euery ſide round about. In olde time this countrey was called <hi>Alemanie,</hi> of the lake <hi>Lemanus</hi> (vulgarly now called <hi>Lac de Loſanne</hi> or <hi>Lac de Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neue,</hi> the Germans call it, <hi>Ienfferlee</hi>) as ſome thinke.</p>
            <p>The countrey, as <hi>Iohn Auban</hi> in that worthy worke of his, <hi>De moribus gentium,</hi> deſcribeth it, is partly champian, partly hilly. The ſoile is fruitfull, of which there is no part which lieth vntilled, excepting that which Lakes, Mountaines or Woods do poſſeſſe. In it are many woods; and therefore the nation is giuen much to hunting and hawking: they haue abundance of corne, and great ſtore of cattell. The whole prouince by reaſon of the holſomneſſe of the aire is euery where repleniſhed with goodly cities, villages, caſtles and bulwarks ſtrongly fortified aſwell by nature as arte. About the mountaines it yeeldeth iron, ſiluer, and other mettals. The nation is populous, ſtout, audacious, and warlike: and therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> calleth it, The moſt excellent nation of all the Germans. Whoſe renowme is recorded to be ſuch and ſo to be enlarged, that for valour and feats of armes it ſeemeth to haue deſerued the Empire of the whole world: which indeed it hath moſt gloriouſly for the ſpace of ſomewhat more than an hundred yeeres enioyed. Thus farre out of <hi>Iohn Auban,</hi> where thou mayeſt at large ſee the cuſtomes and maner of life of this nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augusta Vindelicorum, Augspurg</hi> vpon the riuer <hi>Lech,</hi> and <hi>Vlm</hi> vpon <hi>Donaw,</hi> are the moſt famous cities of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince at this day. There are alſo <hi>Campodun, Memmingen, Werd, Nordling,</hi> and others, of which thou mayeſt reade in <hi>Munster. Donaw,</hi> the greateſt riuer of all <hi>Europe,</hi> here taketh his beginning, and paſſeth thorow the middeſt of the countrey. This riuer, laden with threeſcore ſtreames (which <hi>Cuſpinian,</hi> according to the report of <hi>Collimitius,</hi> deſcribeth by name and order) emptieth it ſelfe into <hi>Pontus Euxinus</hi> (the Greeks now call it, <hi>Maurothalaſſa;</hi> the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians <hi>Marmaiore;</hi> the Turkes, as <hi>Busbequius</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Cara-denis,</hi> that is, The blacke-ſea) by ſix huge mouthes. Euery one of which mouthes are ſo great, and the ſtreame ſo violent, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that you ſhall obſerue the ſea to be ouer-maſtered and driuen backe the ſpace of fortie miles, and ſo farre the water to be perceiued to be ſweet.

            <p>Some men doe thinke this countrey to be the higheſt of all <hi>Europe,</hi> for that it is wholly almoſt ſituate within the Alpes, the higheſt mountaines of the ſame <hi>Europe,</hi> and becauſe the greateſt riuers of the ſame, <hi>Rhein, Rhodan</hi> or <hi>Roſne,</hi> and <hi>Po,</hi> ſpringing from hence as from a very high place, do runne into diuers coaſts of the world. This countrey is euerie where full of ſteepe hilles, deepe valleys, great lakes, cleere ſprings and brooks. Theſe mountaines do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare white with continuall ſnow, ſo that to thoſe which behold them afar off, they ſeeme to be nothing but hard ſtone: yet notwithſtanding the Medowes after they haue beene burnt, are found to be very fat. In them are fed ſheepe and kine, from whence great profit ariſeth vnto the inhabitants. For from thence whey, (as <hi>Oſwaldus Molitor</hi> writeth) cheeſe, butter, and other white meats are made in ſuch abundance, that not only <hi>Switzerland</hi> is glutted with ſuch things, but alſo the nations nere adioyning are from thence very plentifully ſerued. For they are tranſported from hence into <hi>Sweueland,</hi> beyond the mountaine <hi>Iura</hi> into <hi>Italie,</hi> and into diuers other places. And that which may hardly be beleeued, as the ſame man affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth for certaine, that of twentie kine the yeerely profit is one hundred crownes, and all charges borne which is beſtowed vpon houſe-keeping, men-ſeruants, and maid-ſeruants. Here-hence it is, that ſo great a people is poſsibly able to liue and be mainteined in ſo ſtrait a place and little plot of ground.</p>
            <p>The thirteene Cantones of this countrey (as we ſaid they are commonly called) are, as <hi>Glarean</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them vp, <hi>Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Wry, Schwitz, Siluan, Tugi, Glaron, Baſell, Friburg, Solodurn Schafhuſen,</hi> and <hi>Keiſer-ſtul.</hi> The gouernment and charge generally of the whole countrey is in the hands of thoſe Cantones: for the rule or gouernment of <hi>Heluetia</hi> is an <hi>Anarchia,</hi> and is not ſubiect to the command of any Prince. Theſe, when there is any thing that falleth out which concerneth the whole countrey or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame, do meet all ioyntly together, and do determine vpon that which they thinke meet: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſeuerall magiſtrates do gouerne the ſeuerall cities. Theſe cities therefore are linked together by a certaine bond of friendſhip and league, whereupon they are called <hi>Eydtgnoſſen,</hi> that is, ioyned in one couenant. Thoſe of <hi>Rotweill, Sangall, Doggenburg,</hi> and <hi>Lepont,</hi> haue combined themſelues alſo to thoſe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Cantons, with the like bond of amitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heluetia</hi> is ſituate (that we may deſcribe it in the plaineſt maner) betweene the riuer <hi>Rhein, S.

            </p>
            <p>We ſaid, that <hi>Switzerland</hi> amongſt the mountaines doth conteine many valleys: of which ſome there are, that do tend from the tops of the Alps toward <hi>Italie,</hi> inhabited of diuers kinds of men. For <hi>Giles Schude</hi> writeth, that thoſe which do inhabit the vale of <hi>Augusta</hi> or <hi>Val de Osta,</hi> where in times paſt the <hi>Salaſsi</hi> dwelt, are for the moſt part all Merchants factors. In <hi>Ceſie</hi> vale they are almoſt all Stone-cutters and Maſons. From <hi>Oſcell</hi> vale do come Cutlers or Smithes, which do make ſword-blades, and kniues, and ſuch as doe turne woodden diſhes and trenchers. All the inhabitants of the vale <hi>Vegeſe</hi> are Chimney-ſweepers, and ſo that ſlouenly kinde of men, which liue by ſweeping of chimneys, and are wont to wander vp and downe thorow <hi>Germany, France, Italie,</hi> and euen as farre as <hi>Sicilia,</hi> are bred here. In the vale <hi>Galanch</hi> they are all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreſſers of Roſen, or Basket-makers. But theſe like beggers wander from countrey to countrey: yet all the reſt do liue vpon their trades.</p>
            <p>Beſides that which <hi>Caeſar, Strabo</hi> and other ancient writers haue written of this countrey, thou mayſt reade many other things in <hi>Giles Schude, Vadian, Francis Niger</hi> of <hi>Baſſana, Munſter, Henry Glarean,</hi> and <hi>Oſwald Molitor</hi> in the commentaries vpon him; as alſo in <hi>Iohn Stumpe,</hi> who hath written an huge volume of this nation.

Moreouer in it is found abſolutely the beſt braſſe, when as ſcarſe other where not any is found that will abide the hammer.

               <p>There is a place in this Map, which the inhabitants call <hi>Czyrcknitzerſee,</hi> of a little towne neere vnto it, called <hi>Czyrcknitz, Lazius</hi> ſaith that <hi>Strabo</hi> calleth it the Mere of <hi>Lugey,</hi> it is ſituate in the prouince of <hi>Carnioll.</hi> This place (ſo I call it; for whether I may more truly terme it a lake, a parke, or a field, I know not) as the ſame <hi>Lazius</hi> hath, euery yeere yeeldeth corne, fiſhing and hunting. But here I thinke it beſt firſt to ſet downe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription out of <hi>George Wernher</hi> a little more at large: It is encloſed, ſaith he, on euery ſide with mountaines, and is in length about a mile and a halfe, but in bredth ſomewhat leſſe. In many places it is eighteene cubits deepe, and where his depth is leaſt, it is equall vnto the full height of a tall man. Out of the hilles round about on euery ſide certeine ſmall brooks do runne, ech from his ſeuerall channell; from the Eaſt coaſt three; from the South, foure. Euery one of theſe the farther they runne, the leſſe water they containe; for the earth ſo continually ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it vp, that at laſt it is wholly conſumed by certeine ſtonie ditches, ſo framed by nature, as they do ſeeme to haue beene made and cut out by the arte and induſtrie of man. <hi>Lazius</hi> thinketh them to be certeine ſignes and arguments of the ſailing of the Argonautes vnder the earth. Heere the waters doe ſo mightily ſwell, that by no meanes they may be receiued: whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that the ditches doe in ſuch maner ſwell backe againe, that neither they only doe not receiue the water, but alſo what they haue receiued, they powre backe againe ſo exceeding ſwiftly, that a nimble horſeman by running ſhall hardly be able to auoid the violence of the ſtreame. Therefore which way ſoeuer the waters ſhall finde any way out, they iſſue forth and ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo broad, that they make a great lake. Theſe waters do returne almoſt as ſwiftly as they came, yet not by thoſe ditches only; but the ground euery where almoſt doth ſo receiue them, as if they were powred thorow a ſieue.

But the commendation of this country, ſet out by <hi>Plinie,</hi> with as great a maieſty of words, as that countrey doth excell the reſt of the countreys of the world, I cannot but I muſt needs, before I paſſe from it, ſet downe in this place by way of digreſsion; for ſo he ſpeaketh of it in his third booke and fift chapter: ITALIE <hi>the nurſe and mother of all nations, choſen by the prouidence of God, to adde a luſtre to the very heauens themſelues, to vnite diſperſed kingdomes, to temper and mollifie their rude and vnciuill maners, to draw the diſſonant, barbarous and ſauage langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſo many diuers people, by the entercourſe of one refined ſpeech to a conference and parley, to teach ciuilitie to men, and briefly to make this one a common countrey for all the nations of the world. But what ſhall I ſay more? Such is the excellencie of all places, that any man ſhall come vnto, ſuch is the maieſtie of all things, and of all people which do poſſeſſe it. The citie of</hi> Rome, <hi>which in it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth only to excell, and to be a worthy face for ſo glorious a necke, with what words or eloquence may I expreſſe it! How beautifull is the countenance of</hi> Campania <hi>by it ſelfe! how great and many are the glorious pleaſures and delights of the ſame! That it is manifeſt that in this one place nature hath ſhewed all her skill in a worke wherein ſhe meant eſpecially to delight. And now indeed ſuch is the vitall and continuall holſomneſſe of the temperate aire, ſuch fertile plaines and champian grounds, ſuch ſunny banks, ſuch harmleſſe foreſts, ſuch coole and ſhady groues, ſuch fruitfull and bountifull kinds of woods, ſuch fertility of corne, vines annd oliues, ſuch goodly flocks of ſheepe, ſuch fat beeues, ſo many lakes, ſuch ſtore of riuers and fountaines euery where watering and bedrenching it, ſo many ſeas, hauens or ports as it were boſomes of the land euery where open and ready to entertaine and receiue the traffique of all lands, and it ſelfe running into the ſea as it were willingly offering it ſelfe and earneſtly deſiring to helpe and ſuccour mortall men diſtreſſed in the ſame. I doe omit to ſpeake of the fine wits, natures and maners of the people of the ſame, as alſo of the ſeuerall nations ouercome by it partly by valour, and partly by humanity. The Graecians themſelues, a nation exceeding prodigall of their owne praiſe and glory, haue iudged ſo of it, calling a great part of it</hi> Magna Graecia, <hi>Great Greece.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He originall of the name of <hi>Forum Iulij, Leander</hi> ſaith, diuers writers haue diuerſly ſought and cenſured. Some doe thinke it ſo called of <hi>Iulius Caeſar. Blondus</hi> ſeemeth to affirme it to haue tooke his name of the citie <hi>Forum Iulij.</hi> Antiquities do teſtifie that this region hath beene called <hi>Aquilegia,</hi> of <hi>Aquilegium</hi> his chiefe or metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane city. Laſtly, it is certaine that it is called <hi>Patria</hi> of the Venetians: which name as yet alſo it reteineth to this day. <hi>Blondus</hi> ſaith, that it was long ſince called <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnia:</hi> but from whence, when, or for what cauſe it was ſo called, he ſheweth not. The firſt that had here ought to doe, were the <hi>Euganei, Veneti, Troiani, Galli;</hi> and after thoſe, the Romans: vnder whom it did continually perſiſt, ſo long as the fortune and maieſtie of the Roman Empire did ſtand ſound and whole: which at laſt declining, it came into the hands and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the barbarous nations which oppreſſed <hi>Italie,</hi> eſpecially the Lombards, and ſo remained vnto the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great. After that, the gouernment thereof was in the power of the Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> vntill at length the Venetians (deſirous to enlarge their territories on this ſide) reduced it wholly vnder their iuriſdiction, who at this day poſſeſſe it.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of the region is thus: It beginneth from a plaine abbuttant vpon the ſea, and ſo by a little and little encreaſing, firſt it riſeth vp in little hilles, and then into very high mountaines, which almoſt on euery ſide ſo encloſe his borders, that this plaine enuironed about with the toppes of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines as with a wall, ſheweth like a Theater, it is open but at one narrow ſtraight, by the which, as by a gate, ferrying ouer the riuer <hi>Sontio</hi> from <hi>Taruiſio,</hi> it may only be entred. The other borders of it, the Alpes on euery ſide doe limit: and therefore not to be come vnto but by the ſea-ports or valleys of the mountaines, or els ouer their tops. It hath vpon the ſea-coaſts very many hauens. In this moſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countrey are large champians watered with many pleaſant ſtreames, and thoſe fields exceeding fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile: for it aboundeth with vines, yeelding a kinde of wine, which <hi>Plinie</hi> reckoneth and commendeth for the beſt, and calleth it <hi>Vinum Pucinum,</hi> of the place. The mountaines of this countrey are very rich almoſt of all ſorts of mettals; to wit, of Iron, Lead, Tinne, Braſſe, Quicke-ſiluer, Siluer and Golde. They haue alſo Marble, white, blacke, and party-coloured: Pretious ſtones; as Carneols, Berylls, &amp;c. and cryſtall. Here are all ſorts of fruits, and apples of a moſt excellent taſte: Woods both for fuell, tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and hunting, moſt ſtately: pleaſant and beautifull meddowes, and paſtures moſt excellent paſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for cattell. The aire is temperate. The fields of themſelues doe abound with all things neceſſary for the vſe of man, as alſo for pleaſure and delight. The people of this countrey are moſt apt not only vnto all artes and liberall ſciences, but alſo for all merchandiſe and ſuch other trades of life. The moſt famous cities in it are <hi>Aquileya,</hi> adorned with the title of a Patriarchy. This citie <hi>Mela</hi> nameth, The rich: In times paſt it was the ſeat of the Emperours, and therefore it was called, Another <hi>Rome,</hi> and was in compaſſe twelue miles. In it there haue beene accounted long ſince an hundred and twentie thouſand citizens. The great proſperitie and flouriſhing eſtate of this citie, eſpecially grew by the great throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hither of Merchants; for that from all quarters almoſt of the world, by reaſon of the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſneſſe of the place, eaſie and ſafe entrance vnto it aſwell by land as by ſea, merchandiſe were conueyed to this citie as to a common ware-houſe. That great trade of merchandiſe ended together with the fortune of the citie, the Venetians growing mightie, and drawing vnto themſelues all meanes of trade and traffique: ſo that now of a moſt flouriſhing and populous city, it is almoſt waſt and deſert. <hi>Vtina,</hi> which alſo is called <hi>Vtinum</hi> (the Italians vulgarly call it, <hi>Vdene;</hi> the Dutch <hi>Weyden</hi>) ſituate in a plaine, hath a ſtrong caſtle built vpon the toppe of an hill, raiſed by the labour and induſtrie of man, contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this day fortie furlongs in compaſſe. <hi>Tergeste Trieste</hi> vpon the ſea ſhore, a colonie of the Romans. <hi>Goritia,</hi> ſometime (if I be not deceiued) called <hi>Noreia.</hi> Here are many monuments of great antiquitie to this day remaining.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He citie of the Cenomanes, ſituate in <hi>Gallia Ciſalpina,</hi> or as now they call it, <hi>Lombardie,</hi> is within the iuriſdiction of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; a citie moſt ſtately built vpon ech banke of the riuer <hi>Adeſe,</hi> but conioyned by foure faire bridges. The ſame riuer as it doth diuide it into two parts, ſo it doth almoſt on euery ſide encloſe it round: ſo that it is not only a commodity vnto the citie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a defence and ornament vnto the ſame. The ſoile of this tract is excellent good, yeelding many things neceſſary and profitable vnto it; Great ſtore of oile and corne, yeelding yeerely great gaines vnto the country people by ſelling and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it to forren nations; Woll for fineneſſe excelling the other ſorts of <hi>Italie.</hi> The citie is moſt excellently and pleaſantly ſeated, beautified with faire and goodly buildings, aſwell priuate as publike. It hath many famous monuments of antiquitie worth the regarding: amongſt the which is the Amphitheater, which the common ſort call <hi>Arena,</hi> The ſand; of all thoſe which remaine in <hi>Italie</hi> or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of <hi>Europe,</hi> the wholleſt and leaſt defaced either by iniurie of times, or rage of barbarous nations. Moreouer, a triumphall arche, in whoſe inſcription this citie is termed COLONIA AVGVSTA VERONA NOVA GALLIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIANA. There are alſo other monuments, which here for breuitie ſake we muſt omit.</p>
            <p>The liberties or ground belonging to this citie is in length, from the little towne <hi>Baruchello,</hi> vnto <hi>Riua</hi> (which is on the farther ſide of <hi>Lago de Garda</hi>) ſixtie fiue miles: in bredth, which beginneth at <hi>La torre delle confine,</hi> vnto <hi>Riuoltella,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie miles: and conteineth in all 1443378. fields (ſo the common people of <hi>Italie</hi> call the meaſure whereby they meaſure their lands, <hi>Seardeonius</hi> interpreteth it Akers) whereof 1223112. are fertile, 220266 are barren: which notwithſtanding dayly (by the induſtry and diligence of the husbandmen) are made more fruitfull.</p>
            <p>There is in this tract a very high mountaine (the Mappe placeth it betweene <hi>Lago de Gardo</hi> and the riuer <hi>Adeſe</hi>) which they call <hi>Baldo.</hi> This hill is very well knowen to Herboriſts and Apothecaries, which flocke hither from all quarters, and do gather many kindes of herbs and roots neceſſary in Phyſicke, and good and holeſome for the vſe of man.</p>
            <p>There is alſo here in a certaine vale called <hi>Policella,</hi> a place named <hi>Negarina:</hi> where there is a very hard ſtone to be ſeene, hauing vpon it teats carued to the iuſt faſhion and proportion of a womans breaſts; out of the which pappes water doth continually diſtill and droppe; wherewith if a nurſe or a woman giuing ſucke doe waſh her breaſts dried vp by ſickneſſe or any other miſchance, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently draweth downe the milke againe. There are alſo other waters of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, giuen by the benefit of nature, both pleaſant and profitable. But the ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader deſirous to know more of this territory, let him reade <hi>Blondus</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> he ſhall be, I dare boldly affirme, ſatisfied at the full. <hi>Torellus Sarayna</hi> hath written a whole booke of the antiquities, originall, gouernment and policy and famous men of the citie of <hi>

It is ſo great, that it may well compare with the greateſt cities of all <hi>Europe.</hi> It hath very longe and large ſuburbes, by which it is greatly augmented ſome of them ſo huge, that they may contend for bigneſſe with other great cities of <hi>Italie.</hi> Notwithſtanding of late yeares they ſuffered great wrecke, by reaſon of the mortall warres and continuall troubles betweene <hi>Charles</hi> the fift and the French and Venetians. By which they were by fire and ſword almoſt vtterly ouerthrowne and deſtroied, although now by great diligence and induſtrie of the citizens they are reedified againe. Wide and deepe diches full of water do compaſſe both the citie and ſuburbes: by which on euery ſide by boate and barge ſuch great ſtore of prouiſion is brought vnto it, that there is not any thing heere which is not to be bought at a reaſonable rate. It is very admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in my conceite, to record the great aboundance and plenty of all things neceſſary for the vſe of man. So many there are and ſuch diuerſe ſorts of Artificers here, and ſo great a concourſe, as is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and may ſcarcely be told: whereupon that common by-word of the vulgar ſort did ariſe, <hi>He that would repaire all Italie, muſt firſt pull downe Millane:</hi> to wit, that by this meanes out of his holes and neſts the ſwarmes of Artificers might be diſpearſed into all quarters of <hi>Italie.</hi> The citie hath very ſtately and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull buildings: eſpecially the gorgeous and ſumptuous edifice, which they call <hi>The houſe,</hi> reered with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite charge, and ſuch wonderfull workemanſhip, that there is but a very few Churches of the whole world that may be compared, vnto it, whether you reſpect the huge greatneſſe, and ingenious Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or the price of the Marble and rare worke of the ſame: for that not onely euery way within and without it is beautifully trimmed and pargetted ouer with white marble, but alſo it is bedecked with a wonderfull imagery, wrought in Marble with exceeding cunning. Beſide very many famous Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Chappels eſpecially Grace church, and Praechers church, ſituate ouer againſt the moſt ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Porta Iouia:</hi> hauing an <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> made by <hi>Lewis Sfortia</hi> the Duke of <hi>Millane:</hi> vnderneath the which hee together with his wife lie buried, encloſed in a tombe of the beſt marble. To this Church is adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſtately Abbey of the Friers Predicant, with a goodly Librarie and a very faire Chamber or Hall trimmed about with the ſtorie of the ſupper of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, an admirable peece of worke, done by the hand of <hi>Leonardo Vincio</hi> a Florentine ſufficiently approuing the great skill and cunning of the ingenious workeman, by the iudgement of all men experienced in the Art of painting. There are very many gorgeous houſes of priuate citizens euery where to be ſeene within the citie. The Caſtle of <hi>Porta Iouia,</hi> is the ſtrongeſt and beſt contriued fortification in all Chriſtendome, which hitherto could neuer be ſurprized and forcibly taken by any enemie. There are beſides theſe very many excellent buildings in <hi>Millane,</hi> which heere I muſt paſſe ouer with ſilence. Thus farre <hi>Leander,</hi> who doth excellently deſcribe the reſt of the townes and places of his territories of this citie. See alſo <hi>Volateran</hi> in his Geography, <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Merula, Bernard Arlun,</hi> and <hi>Bonauenture Caſtillion,</hi> who hath written a ſeuerall Treatiſe of the <hi>Inſubres,</hi> of their auncients ſeats and antiquities. Moreouer <hi>Bernardine Corius</hi> hath written the Millane hiſtorie in the Italian tongue. <hi>Laonicus Chalcocondylas</hi> alſo ſpeaketh ſomething of the happy eſtate of this citie, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things he doth excellently deſcribe and ſet out the fable of the Dragon, which made this citie deſolate in the time of the <hi>Mariangeli,</hi> from whence the armes and cogniſance of this city were deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as is very likely. But it will not be amiſſe to adioine to theſe the opinion of <hi>Procopius,</hi> who writeth that this city doth ſurpaſſe the city of <hi>Rome</hi> in greatneſſe, multitude of citizens, and other great bleſsings of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liguria</hi> alſo, which in this Chart is wholly deſcribed, is bounded with the riuers <hi>Varo</hi> and <hi>Magra,</hi> the Apenine mountaines and the Liguſticke ſea, (a branch of the Mediterranean ſea) now called <hi>Leonino.</hi> This now they call <hi>Riuiera di Genoa,</hi> of <hi>Genua</hi> his chiefe citie.

It hath beene graced with the title of a Duchie, for ſo I find written in <hi>Diaconus</hi> his 5. booke of <hi>Lombardie</hi> in the 36. Chapter. But becauſe that none of the late writers, (that I may ſay nought of the more ancient) haue deſcribed this citie more learnedly and eloquently, than <hi>Pighius</hi> in his <hi>Hercules Prodicius,</hi> thou ſhalt heare him ſpeake in his owne termes. <hi>Breſcia</hi> which is ſeated at the foot of the mountaines, may contend with moſt of the cities of <hi>Italie,</hi> for antiquitie and ſtatelineſſe of buildings, <hi>Iulius Caeſar Scaliger,</hi> a famous Poet of our age, hath thus deſcribed it in this Epigramme; <hi>Thou</hi> Brixia <hi>great which proudly ouerlook'st the boornes and lowlie plaine, by due deſert now iustlie mayst the ſoueraigne Empire claime. Thy healthfull ſeat, thy pleaſant fertile ſoile, thy people wiſe and nation ſtout, If ciuill diſcord had not croſst, long ſince had brought about, That where long time thou hast beene thrall, and ſtoop'st to others lore; Thou mightest haue lorded ouer thoſe, to whom thou ſerud'st before.</hi> For this Citie by reaſon of ciuill diſcord and diſſention, being ſubdued vnder the yoke of the French and their next neighbours the Inſubres, or the Millaners, hath endured much miſerie: yet now at length, vnder the peaceable gouernment of the Venetians, it is growen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wealthy, a great market well furniſhed with all things neceſſary, very populous and inhabited of a wiſe and diſcreet nation. The ſhire is very fertile of oile, wine, corne, and moſt excellent fruites of all ſorts. It hath alſo ſome rich veines of Mettalls, but eſpecially of Iron and Copper; whereof ariſeth to this citie great gaine and commodity. <hi>Liuie</hi> and other good authors report, That <hi>Breſcia</hi> was built by the <hi>Galli Cenomanes,</hi> about the time of the Romane kings, which afterward the Romanes, hauing ſubdued all that part of the countrey of the <hi>Gaules</hi> which lieth beyond the riuer <hi>Po,</hi> reduced vnder their iuriſdiction. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant out of <hi>Liuie,</hi> how firme it ſometimes ſtood with the Romans, eſpecially in thoſe moſt dangerous warres between them and <hi>Hanniball.</hi> Some would haue it to haue beene made a Colonie preſent after the end of the League-warre, when as <hi>Cneius Pompeius Strabo,</hi> the father of <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, planted colonies in <hi>Verona</hi> and other cities beyond the riuer <hi>Po.</hi> Not long after, by the fauour of <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> it together with other cities there about, obtained the freedome of the city of <hi>Rome,</hi> and after that it is woonderfull how it flouriſhed vnder the Roman Emperours, ſo long as the greatneſſe of that Empire ſtood vnſhaken: This, diuers monuments of Antiquitie, which as yet remaine in this city and in the liberties of the ſame: as namely many goodly inſcriptions of marble, ſtatues, pillars, and Epitaphes of famous men, do conſtantly auerre, by which the former great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this city may eaſily be gathered. Thus farre <hi>Pighius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baptista Nazario</hi> wrote a ſeuerall Treatiſe of this city, in the which he ſetteth downe all the inſcriptions of the auncient monuments of this country. <hi>Helias Capriolus</hi> hath comprized the whole hiſtorie of this citie in 12. bookes. <hi>Gaudentius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula,</hi> in his tract of the originall and antiquitie of the Ciſalpines, ſpeaketh ſomewhat of it, as alſo <hi>Chryſoſtomus Zanchus,</hi> writing of the originall of the <hi>Orobij</hi> and <hi>Cenomanes,</hi> likewiſe <hi>Leander Albertus</hi> and lately <hi>Andrete Paccius</hi> in his ſixth booke of the Wines of <hi>Italie.</hi> There is in this prouince a towne called <hi>Quintianum,</hi> 20. miles ſouth-eaſtward from <hi>Breſcia,</hi> neere to the riuer <hi>Ollio,</hi> of the which <hi>Iohn Planer</hi> a citizen of the ſame wrote a ſmall Treatiſe, who in an Epiſtle of his to <hi>Paullus Manutius,</hi> doth highly commend it both for learning and chiualrie. Whether this be that <hi>Quintianum,</hi> of which <hi>Optatus</hi> after ſpeaketh, I leaue to the learned to determine.</p>
            <p>The riuer <hi>Mela</hi> or <hi>Mella;</hi> of which <hi>Virgil</hi> maketh mention, doth runne through the middeſt of this ſhire; as alſo <hi>Catullus</hi> in this verſe affirmeth, <hi>Brixia Cygnaea poſitus in ſpecula, Flauus quam molli percurrit flumine Mella.</hi> Old <hi>Brixia</hi> plac'd amidde the brookes, as gardian of the Swans, The riuer <hi>Mella</hi> kindly greet'th, and watereth all his lands. This riuer retaineth the name of <hi>Mella</hi> vnto this day. Notwithſtanding it runneth not by it now, as you may ſee, although not farre off from thence it paſſeth through his liberties. The little riuer which runneth along by the city, is now called <hi>Garza:</hi> but I thinke that in old time it was alſo called <hi>Mella.</hi> And I thinke I may truly affirme, that the riuer <hi>Mella,</hi> when it approacheth neere vnto the city, ſpreadeth it ſelfe into two channells, both of them retaining the ſame name, do make a riuer-iland, (like as <hi>Nilus</hi> maketh <hi>Heracleopolites,</hi>) and then againe falling into one ſtreame ſtill keepe the name of <hi>Mella,</hi> and hauing ſo, heauily laden, runne for many miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at length it vnladeth it ſelfe into the riuer <hi>Ollio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I finiſh the diſcourſe of this Mappe, I haue thought good to ſay ſomewhat of the Lakes of the ſame. The lake <hi>Benacus</hi> (called of the poet <hi>Catullus, Lydius) Capriolus</hi> thinketh to haue been ſo named of the city <hi>Benaco,</hi> ſometime ſeated vpon his brinke, a mention of which to this day remaineth ſtill in a village called <hi>Toſcolano,</hi> which thou ſeeſt vpon his weſt ſide, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon a brooke of the ſame name. A memoriall of this city is preſerued in an auncient monument, whoſe inſcription <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> ſetteth downe in his Orthographie. This lake is now called <hi>Garda,</hi> of the caſtle <hi>Garda</hi> placed oppoſite vnto <hi>Benaco</hi> vpon his eaſt banke. This lake, as <hi>Alexius Vgonius</hi> writeth in a letter of his to <hi>Cardinall Poole,</hi> aboundeth with ſtore of fiſh, which for goodneſſe do far ſurpaſſe all others. It is encloſed on euery ſide with moſt pleaſant hilles: into it from all quarters the cleare fountaines flow. Goodly meddowes, vines, oliues, beeches, laurell, and cedars; beſides townes, furniſhed with all maner of neceſſarie prouiſion, like a crowne beſet it round on euery ſide: ſo that nothing at all of thoſe things may further be deſired, which may make a champion country either beautifull to the eie, or commendable for profit and commodities &amp;c. While I was writing of this, there came into my mind what ſpeech I once had of this lake, with that moſt learned good man <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Arias Montanus,</hi> (for we both had ſeene the ſame, although not at the ſame time) in which we both did proteſt either to other, that we neuer in all our liues had ſeene a place either more pleaſant for ſituation, or more delightſome to the eie, ſo that it was no maruell that <hi>Catullus</hi> did ſo highly commend in his Epigrammes, that his <hi>Sirmion,</hi> and the waters of this lake. The other lake in this Cart is <hi>Sebinus</hi> or <hi>Seuinnus</hi> (for <hi>Plinie</hi> vſeth both) made by the riuer <hi>Ollio.</hi> This now they call <hi>Iſeo,</hi> of a town of the ſame name ſituate vpon his banke. There is alſo another lake which they call <hi>Idro;</hi> by what name it was called of the auncients, or whether by any, I doe not certainly know. I know, that a certaine learned man doth hold it to be <hi>Brigantinus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> whereof <hi>Plinie</hi> ſpeaketh; but why I am not of his opinion, I haue ſhewed reaſons in my Geographicall treaſure.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat prouince which was formerly called <hi>Taurinorum regio,</hi> is now termed <hi>Piemont</hi> or <hi>Pedemont,</hi> for that it is ſeated at the bottome of the Alpes, which do diuide <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sauoy</hi> from <hi>Italie,</hi> and ſo is as one would ſay, The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince at the foot of the hilles. The bounds of this country are thus: on the Eaſt, the riuer <hi>Po:</hi> on the South, the Alpes of <hi>Liguria:</hi> vpon the Weſt, the Alpes of <hi>France:</hi> on the North, <hi>Riuiera di Duria:</hi> It hath many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fields full of pleaſant and fruitfull hilles, which yeeld corne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorts of graine, excellent wines and fruite great ſtore. It is well reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Cities, Townes, and Villages.</p>
            <p>Vnder the gouernment of the Lombardes it was called, The Dukedome of <hi>Taurine,</hi> (ſo named of the city <hi>Taurin.</hi>) By them it was firſt reduced into the forme of a prouince, vnder the iuriſdiction of a Duke. The gouernment of the Lombardes being come vnto a period, it was made ſubiect to the Kings of <hi>Italie,</hi> who were alwaies choſen by the Emperours: after that it was gouerned by diuers Petie Kings: and long ſince, in later ages it was accounted as part of the iuriſdiction of the Princes, Earles, and Dukes of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> vntill the yeare 1536. when as <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France</hi> tooke a great part of it: and now it is againe reſtored to the Duke of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> The chiefe city of this Prouince is <hi>Turin,</hi> ſeated at the mouth of the riuer <hi>Dorra,</hi> where it falleth into <hi>Po.</hi> This citie <hi>Ptolemey, Plinie</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> call <hi>Auguſta Taurinorum.</hi> That this citie in old time was a very famous citie, it may eaſily appeare, in that it was a colonie of the Romanes. It lieth at the foot of the mountaines, it is foure ſquare, and hath foure goodly gates. It is very famous for the rich Iſle and ſtate of the citizens, and is adorned with many goodly buildings, amongſt the which the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Church is moſt beautifull. It hath an Vniuerſitie of all maner of goodly learning: and is very well ſerued with all ſorts of prouiſion of victuall. The countrie is of a very good and fertile ſoile, eſpecially toward the Eaſt and South, hauing Vallies moſt rich for veines of Iron. <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> affirmeth that <hi>Taurin</hi> was the ſeat of the Lombardes: vnto whom it was ſubiect vntill <hi>Deſiderius</hi> their king was ouercome and taken by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great: and then it was brought vnder the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the Kings of <hi>Italie,</hi> Emperours, Countes, Montferrate and Marchions, and Dukes of <hi>Sauoy;</hi> to whom at this time it is obedient. Neere the head of the riuer <hi>Po</hi> toward <hi>Ripell</hi> (or <hi>C. de Reuell</hi>) and <hi>Paiſana,</hi> are quarries of moſt excellent Marble.</p>
            <p>Vpon the North ſide of the fountaine of the riuer <hi>Po,</hi> beginneth a certaine pleaſant valley cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Vale of <hi>Po,</hi> or (as the inhabitants terme it) the Vale of <hi>Luſerna,</hi> of the towne <hi>Luſerna</hi> which ſtandeth in it. It runneth out in length thirtie miles, and is not aboue foure miles broad. In the entrance of his Eaſtend, is <hi>Mambrinum;</hi> in the end toward the Weſt is a very high ſtone croſſe. The people of this place are commonly called, <hi>The Chriſtians,</hi> but in ſome maners and cuſtomes which they vſe, they ſcarſe follow the ſtrickt rules of Chriſtianity: nay they do obſerue moſt vngodly and wicked rites and ceremonies: amongſt which this is one; That once in a moneth they obſerue one day, in the which all meeting in a Church, after a collation made by their filthie and wicked Superintendent, at night, the Candles being put out; without any choice or regard, they fall like bruite beaſtes vnto their beaſtly Venerie. This we haue taken out of <hi>Leander,</hi> where thou maiſt read, if thou pleaſeſt, many other ſuch like things. <hi>Dominicus Niger</hi> alſo hath written of this Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paradine</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Sauoy</hi> writeth, That the Dukedome of <hi>Piemont</hi> doth conteine in it, beſide goodly Cities, great and populous (which are in number fiue) more then fiftie Townes well fortified and beautifull; and alſo two hundred Borrowes, walled and fenced with Fortreſſes and Caſtles.

It is a moſt goodly, beautifull and pleaſant country. The people are very ingenious and of a ſubtile witte, indifferently fitte either for peace or warre: for all maner of humane litterature, or for trades and merchandiſe. The nation hath alwaies been ſuperſtitious and much giuen to deuotion in religion, as is apparant out of ancient writers. The ſea coaſt toward the <hi>Tyrrhen</hi> or Mediterran ſea, is for the moſt part in this our age full of Forreſts, as alſo it was in the time of <hi>Vopiſcus,</hi> as he witneſſeth in the life of <hi>Aurelian;</hi> eſpecially a little beyond the riuer <hi>Arno,</hi> vntill one come beyond <hi>Plumbino.</hi> The inner part of the country is almoſt as much oppreſſed with Mountaines.</p>
            <p>In it are theſe cities, more famous than the reſt, <hi>Florence, Siena, Luca, Perugia, Piſa, Viterbo,</hi> &amp;c. FLORENCE, or as they call it <hi>Fiorenza,</hi> is ſituate vpon ech ſide of the riuer <hi>Arno,</hi> conioined by foure faire bridges: it is a moſt goodly and beautifull city, whereupon commonly they call it <hi>Fiorenza la bella, Florence</hi> the faire: as if indeed it might ſeeme to bee the flower of all <hi>Italie.</hi> For it is adorned with ſtately buildings, aſwell Churches and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſes, as of priuate citizens. Amongſt all other the Church of <hi>S. Maria Florida,</hi> wholly ouerlaid with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, arched with a roofe of an admirable workemanſhip, neere to which is built a goodly ſteeple for the bels, all of fine marble: not farre from which ſtandeth the ancient Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> of forme round very ingeniouſly built, and of a cunning workemanſhip, now dedicated to <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> The dores of this Church are of caſt braſſe; a very rare and curious peece of worke: eſpecially thoſe which are next to the Church of <hi>S. Maria Florida,</hi> are ſuch that all men of iudgement and experience muſt abſolutely confeſſe that in all <hi>Europe</hi> beſide, the like are no where to be ſeene. But to reckon vp all the worthy buildings of this citie, aſwell ſacred as profane it were too tedious and would require more paper than this our purpoſed diſcourſe will beare; He therefore that deſireth to know more of the particulers more at large, let him reade <hi>Leander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SIENA lieth vpon the top of an hill, round begirt with high rocks of Tophus-ſtone, gorgeouſly bedecked with many noble mens houſes: amongſt the which is the great and large Church of our Lady, equall to the ſtatelieſt and ſumptuouſeſt Churches of all <hi>Europe;</hi> whether you reſpect the worth and price of the Marble whereof it is built: or the excellencie of the worke and workemanſhip of him that made it. Beſides that there is a moſt ſtately houſe of tree ſtone built by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> II. with many other goodly houſes. Worthy of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and record is the large and beautifull market place, with <hi>Branda</hi> the pleaſant fountaine alwaies full of moſt cleare water.</p>
            <p>PERVGIA is ſeated vpon the mountaine Apennine, the greateſt part of the countrie ariſing with goodly pleaſant hilles, fertile of ſtrong Wines, Oiles, Figges, Apples, and other ſorts of moſt excellent fruits. Beneath the citie at <hi>Aſiſia,</hi> as alſo toward <hi>Tuder,</hi> neere <hi>Tiber,</hi> the pleaſant champion fields do ſpread themſelues, yeelding plenty of wheat and other kind of graine. The city by reaſon of the nature of the place is very ſtrong, adorned with gorgeous buildings both of religious houſes and churches as alſo priuate citizens: together with a famous and large fountaine in the middeſt of the citie. It is very populous and the citizens are very ingenious and of couragious ſtomackes, apt indifferently either for any maner litterature or for ſeruice in the field.</p>
            <p>PISA, long ſince hath beene a famous citie and many waies richly bleſſed, not onely before the flouriſhing eſtate of the Roman Empire, but euen when it was at the full height: as alſo many yeares after. Many famous Marine-conqueſts, which it hath made, by which it brought the Ile <hi>Sardinia</hi> ſubiect to their command, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch this to be true. <hi>Panormo</hi> a faire citie of <hi>Sicilia</hi> they won from the Saracens: and of the bootie and ſpoiles taken in that warre, they began to build the great Church, which they call DOMNVM, as alſo the beautifull palace of the Biſhop. It hath an Vniuerſitie or Schoole of all maner of Liberall Arts and Sciences, whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was laid in the yeare of CHRIST 1309.</p>
            <p>VITERBO lieth in a pleaſant and ſpacious champion hauing the Cyminian hilles (now of this citie called <hi>Mont Viterbo</hi>) vpon his backeſide, ſtately for many faire buildings and works of rare Art, amongſt which is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fountaine, from whence iſſueth water in ſuch abundance as is wonderfull.</p>
            <p>LVCA is ſeated in a plaine, not farre from the hilles foot, a city of goodly buildings. The people are neat, wiſe and ingenious; which haue moſt diſcreetly retained and kept their libertie of a long time whole in their owne hands, although they haue been often aſſaulted by their neighbours.

            <head>The Signiory of FLORENCE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the city of <hi>Florence</hi> read <hi>Blondus,</hi> who in his view of <hi>Italie</hi> reporteth thus of it: They commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, ſaith he, that this citie was firſt begonne by <hi>Sylla's</hi> ſouldiers, vnto whom this part of the countrie was by <hi>Sylla</hi> aſsigned: and becauſe they firſt began to ſeat themſelues <hi>ad Arna fluenta,</hi> about the riuer <hi>Arno,</hi> they then intituled it by the name of FLVENTIA. And indeed <hi>Pliny,</hi> who of all the old writers firſt mentioneth this place, ſaith that the <hi>Fluentini</hi> were ſeated neere the riuer <hi>Arno.</hi> Theſe ſouldiers came hither about the yeare after the building of the city of <hi>Rome,</hi> 667. whereupon it appeareth that <hi>Florence</hi> was founded about 83. yeares before the birth of Chriſt. This city ſuffered much wrecke in the time of the warres of the Gothes. Yet was it neuer, either by <hi>Totilas,</hi> or any other of thoſe ragings Tyrants, vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raſed or ſpoiled: And therefore that which ſome do write of the repairing of <hi>Florence</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, I can by no meanes allow when as the hiſtories of <hi>Charles</hi> written by <hi>Alcuinus</hi> his ſchoolemaſter, do only mention his keeping of Eaſter heere at two ſeuerall times, as he went by this way toward <hi>Rome.</hi> It was preſerued from a great hazard of vtter ouerthrow, which it was like to haue fallen into, by the manhood of one <hi>Farinata Vber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,</hi> when as they of <hi>Piſa, Siena,</hi> and others of <hi>Tuſcane,</hi> meeting at a market in a conſultation by them held, hauing generally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to raſe <hi>Florence</hi> to the ground, ſaid ſtoutly: That while he liued, he would neuer ſuffer his deare Mother, which brought him vp, by them to be ſpoiled. Therefore <hi>Florence</hi> partly taking by force, and partly by other meanes drawing to their part the Feſulanes, about the yeare of Chriſt, 1024. was much enlarged in wealth and authoritie: at which time alſo <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> built the goodly Church of S. <hi>Miniate</hi> neere the walles of <hi>Florence.</hi> This city was twiſe within a little while, in the yeare 1176. miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably defaced, by caſualty of fire. From which time it firſt began to be gouerned as now it is by the <hi>Priori,</hi> (the maſters of the twelue companies) and a Standard-bearer, <hi>Gonfalonerio,</hi> they call him. One of the firſt Gonfalonerios was <hi>Stroza,</hi> a nobleman borne, of a great houſe. The goodly <hi>Minſter</hi> which in our time, by the ingenious direction of <hi>Philippo Brunalitio,</hi> a Florentine, was moſt ſtately arched, and dedicated to our Lady, was begun in the yeare of our Lord 1294. Foure yeares after that was that gorgeous Palace, where now the <hi>Priori,</hi> or Aldermen do keepe, firſt founded. And fiue yeares after that was the <hi>Pomoerium,</hi> (the proſpect, or waſt ground, round about the city) leuelled and the walles of the city enlarged. <hi>Piſtorio</hi> was the firſt city that the Florentines ſubdued vnder their command, as <hi>Leander,</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Italie,</hi> affirmeth vpon the teſtimony of <hi>Aretino:</hi> where alſo he hath theſe words, of the diuers forms and different maner of gouernment of the ſame; After that it was repaired, ſaith he, by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, they yearely choſe two Conſuls or Sheriffes, who with the aſsiſtance of 100. Senatours or Aldermen, ſhould gouerne the city. This forme of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth being altered, they created the <hi>Decemuiri,</hi> the tenne, called of them <hi>Antiani,</hi> about the yeare of Grace, 1220. as <hi>Volaterran</hi> affirmeth, or as <hi>Blondus</hi> ſaith in the yeare 1254. After that in the yeare 1287. hauing redeemed their freedome of the Emperour <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfe</hi> for 60000. crownes, as <hi>Platina</hi> writeth, the <hi>Decemuiri,</hi> (the tenne) were reduced to <hi>Octouiri,</hi> (eight) and were called the <hi>Priori,</hi> (the maiſters of the companies) ouer whom was ſet the Standerd-bearer, called by them <hi>Gonfalonerio di Giuſtitia,</hi> the Lord chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; which office they were to hold but two monethes, and then others were to be elected. This forme of policy, for as much as I can gather out of hiſtoriographers, was ſince that time thriſe altered. Firſt in the yeare 1343. when the Florentines bought <hi>Luca</hi> of <hi>Maſtino Scaligero</hi> for 5000. crownes; their forces being ouerthrowne by the enemie, they were conſtrained to demand aid of <hi>Robert</hi> King of Naples, and obtained <hi>Gualterio Gallo</hi> a captaine of <hi>Athens</hi> for their generall, who by great ſubtilty and cunning getting the rule of the city, went to the Court and there depoſed the <hi>Priori,</hi> and other Magiſtrates from their office. Yet he enioied not his vſurped authority long, for the people at the perſuaſion of <hi>Angelo Accieuolo</hi> Biſhop of the ſea a Frier predicant, roſe vp in armes, and depoſing the Tyrant, reſtored the <hi>Priori</hi> and <hi>Confalonerio</hi> to their places againe. The ſecond alteration of this Common-wealth happened in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when as his ſonne <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> Duke of <hi>Valence,</hi> (neuer labouring to bring home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <hi>Peter, Iohn</hi> and <hi>Iulian,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Laurence Medices,</hi> who but lately had beene baniſhed) at length brought the matter ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that the office of the <hi>Gonfalonerio</hi> ſhould be giuen to <hi>Peter Soderine</hi> for a perpetuall and ſtanding office: who together with the <hi>Priori</hi> choſen euery two moneths, after the ancient cuſtome, moſt wiſely behaued himſelfe and orderly gouerned that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: vntill at length being expelled by <hi>Raimundo Cordona</hi> Embaſſadour of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and Naples, (who was to reſtore <hi>Iohn Cardinall Medices,</hi> and his brother <hi>Iulian,</hi>) in the yeare of Grace 1412. and erecting the ancient maner of gouernment, which continued vntill the yeare 1530. In the meane time, although the city were commanded, at the diſcretion and direction of the Popes <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, (which was <hi>Iohn Medices,</hi>) and <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth, (which was <hi>Iulius Medices</hi>) the baſtard ſonne of <hi>Iulian,</hi> the firſt Cardinall <hi>Cortoneſſe,</hi> hauing the wardſhip, and being Gardian to <hi>Hippolytus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iulian</hi> the ſecond) &amp; of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the baſtard ſonne of <hi>Laurenznio,</hi> the nephew of <hi>Peter</hi> the ſecond. Yet notwithſtanding the ancient Magiſtrates were choſen after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome formerly vſed. In that ſame yeare therefore, when as three yeares before, the Emperours ſouldiers beſieging <hi>Clement</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth in <hi>Hadrians</hi> caſtle, the city ſhaking off the yoke of bondage, obteined freedome, and endeuoured by all meanes to retaine the ſame, <hi>Philip</hi> the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> leading the armie of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. <hi>Clement</hi> entreating that <hi>Alexander</hi> his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, whom before he had intituled Duke of <hi>Penna,</hi> to be brought againe into the city, forced it being much diſtreſſed for want of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to yeeld to the obedience of the Emperour. <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour at the requeſt of <hi>Clement</hi> the Pope preſently created <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> perpetuall Priour: and thus the offices of the <hi>Priori</hi> and <hi>Gonfalonerio</hi> were vtterly taken away. Then, when the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> had created <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and giuen vnto him in mariage <hi>Margaret</hi> his baſtard daughter, in the yeare of our Sauiour, 1535. and two yeares after that, before the ſeuenth day of Ianuarie, <hi>Laurence Medices,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Peter Francis,</hi> that he might ſet his natiue country at liberty, as he pretended, had miſerably ſlaine him. <hi>Coſmus Medices</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iohn Medices</hi> was created Duke in his roome. Thus farre <hi>Leander,</hi> vnto which I may adioine theſe words of my kind friend M. <hi>Iohn Pinadello:</hi> When it was known ſaith he, to <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Coſmus Medices,</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> had at that time taken great paines for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Church and Religion, and ſpared no coſt in the warres againſt the hereticks, in the yeare 1570. in the moneth of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie comming to the city, crowned him in <hi>Aula Regia,</hi> the Kings hall (a place in <hi>Vaticana</hi> ſo named) and gaue him and his ſucceſſours, the title of, The great Duke. In whoſe Crowne the Pope cauſed theſe words to be engrauen, PIVS QVINTVS <hi>Pont. Max. ob exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miam dilectionem, &amp; Catholicae religionis zelum, praecipuum<expan>

            <p>I thinke it not amiſſe here to adioine another ſhort diſcourſe, becauſe it is rare, and not altogether from the purpoſe: It is thus as <hi>Syffridus Preſbyter</hi> reporteth in <hi>George Fabricius</hi> his hiſtorie of <hi>Miſnia. Otho</hi> the third Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> lying at <hi>Mutina</hi> with his wife, the Empreſſe fell in loue with a certaine Earle: but when as he by no meanes would conſent vnto her, ſhe ſo diffamed him vnto her husband, the Emperour, that he commanded him to be beheaded before euer he had examined the matter. Who before he was beheaded, entreated his wife, that after his death by the triall of Hoate Iron, ſhe would approue to the view of the world, how wrongfully he was put to death. The day came, when as the Emperour ſate to heare the cauſes and complaints of widdowes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes. Together with theſe came the late Counteſſe, bringing in her hand the Earles head: and demandeth what death that Iudge is worthy of, that had put a man to death wrongfully? The Emperour anſwered, He is worthy to loſe his head. She ſaith, Thou art the ſame man, who at the falſe ſuggeſtion of thy wife didſt vniuſtly cauſe my husband to be beheaded. The which when as the widdow approued vnto him by the maner of triall by hoat iron, the Emperour yeelded himſelfe into the hands of the widdow, willing to abide his deſerued puniſhment. Notwithſtanding by the mediation of the Biſhop and the Nobility, he obtained of the Counteſſe reſpite for tenne daies, then for eight, then for ſeuen, laſtly for ſix. After the end of which daies, the Emperour hauing examined the matter, and being aſſured of the truth, gaue ſentence againſt his wife, that ſhe ſhould be burned at a ſtake, and giuing foure caſtles vnto the widdow, redeemed his life. Theſe caſtles are in the Biſhopricke of <hi>Luna</hi> in <hi>Hetruria</hi> or <hi>Tuſcane,</hi> and they are called after the names of the daies of repreeue, The tenth, The eighth, The ſeuenth, and The ſixth. Thus farre <hi>Syffridus,</hi> which I thought good to ſet down in this place, for to my knowledge no man els hath left any record of theſe caſtles: neither are they named in this Mappe by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, notwithſtanding that he hath deſcribed the country moſt curiouſly.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ohannes Campanus</hi> writing of this country, affirmeth that although he had trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and viewed many countries, yet he neuer ſaw in all his life a more pleaſant country, and better manured then the country of <hi>Perugia.</hi> All things ſeeme waſt and wild to thoſe that are farre off, but if you ſhall come more neere, nothing may be found more glorious either in reſpect of the husbandry of the land, or wholeſomneſſe of the aire, or fertility of the ſoile. The riuer of <hi>Tiber</hi> runneth through the middeſt of this country, and kindly watereth the ſame. Not farre from which is the city <hi>Perugia,</hi> ſituate vpon the Mount <hi>Apennine,</hi> built long ſince (as <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> affirmeth) by the Achaians; and of the twelue cities of <hi>Hetruria</hi> it is the chiefe. It was called <hi>Auguſta</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as the Capitall letters halfe a yeard ſquare, grauen vpon the gate, do declare. This city, in regard of the nature of the place, is inuincible, richly beautified both with religious and priuate buildings of great ſtate, and is very populous. This city aboue all the cities of <hi>Italie</hi> hath been euermore moſt fortunate and happie, hauing retained the ſame ſtate and gouernment little or nothing altered, which it enioied before the building of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that which afterward it had, (in the time when <hi>Rome</hi> was ruled by Kings, Conſuls, Emperours and Tyrants) at this time it reteineth. Yet it hath endured many and diuers greeuous and bitter ſtorms. For in the time when <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> was Conſull, as <hi>Liuie</hi> reporteth, 4500. of his citizens were ſlaine. In the daies of the <hi>Triumuiri, Auguſtus</hi> beſiedged it, and forced it to great diſtreſſe for want of victualls, tooke it and raſed it to the ground, and was wholly defaced with fire, except only the Temple of <hi>Vulcane,</hi> as <hi>Appian</hi> recordeth. Afterward it endured the ſeuen yeares ſiedge and batterie of the cruell Tyrant <hi>Totilas,</hi> and at length was ſacked and ſpoiled &amp;c. Now it is ſubiect to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath a famous Vniuerſitie, which was erected about the yeare of CHRIST, 1290. as <hi>Middendorpius</hi> hath written. Heere in the time of our grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, flouriſhed the moſt renowmed Ciuilians, <hi>Bartholus</hi> and <hi>Baldus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the precincts of this city is <hi>Lago di Perugia,</hi> the lake of <hi>Perugia,</hi> anciently called LACVS TRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVMENVS, famous long ſince for a great ouerthrow heere giuen by <hi>Hanniball</hi> to the Romanes; <hi>Appianus</hi> calleth it <hi>Lacus Pleſtinus,</hi> but for what reaſon I know not. It is in compaſſe, as the foreſaid <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panus</hi> writeth, about thirtie miles. The water of it is very cleare and pure, there are no riuers which runne into it, neither hath it any iſſue forth, yet is his water ſo exceeding ſweet, that any man would thinke it were fedde from ſome running fountaine. It hath in it three Iſles, whereof two, which are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North, are cloſe together; the one called the Greater, the other the Leſſer: (<hi>Maiores</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores</hi>) This is waſt and not in habited, only it hath a Church ſituate vpon the toppe of an hill. The other, which is neere to the liberties of <hi>Cortona,</hi> conteineth about 200. families. The third, which is toward the South, and is bigger then the other two, is very populous and well inhabited. The inhabitants almoſt giue themſelues wholly to Fiſhing; they ſow little Corne: yet they do not neglect to plant vines. For wood, fuell and fodder they go out into the fields and woods neere adioining. Amongſt the records of <hi>Lewis</hi> firſt Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is mention of theſe three Ilands, where he nameth them MAIOR MINOR and PVLVENSIS, (now <hi>Polueſo</hi>) where I perceiue that they yet retaine their ancient names. No boggs, fennes, or ſpuing meeres do impech the ſhore: this is full of Oliue gardens, which vpon the hills on euery ſide do adorne the Lake, and are for their wonderfull fertility very beautifull. In the plaine which is between the Lake and the Hilles, there is ſuch abundance of Hempe and Flax, ſo that in all <hi>Hetruria</hi> or <hi>Tuſcane,</hi> there is not more. No country yeldeth better Wines or ſweeter Apples. The kinds of Fiſhes in the lake are not many, but the abundance is wonderfull; in which it farre excelleth all other Lakes of <hi>Italie:</hi> heere alſo the fiſhing continueth all the yeare long, yea euen in the dead of winter, which no other Lake in all <hi>Italie</hi> affoordeth. Theſe fiſh in the winter are caried into <hi>Tuſcane, Vmbria,</hi> and <hi>Picenta:</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> alſo they driue much cattell daily to be ſold. The ſame <hi>Campanus</hi> affirmeth, that heere they take a pickerell partly coloured, ſpotted with diuers green ſpecks, of the which he reporteth ſtrange wonders: namely, that it doth engender with ſerpents, and from thence it getteth thoſe ſtrange colours. (The common people, ſaith <hi>Iacobus Greumus,</hi> in the twentieth chapter of his firſt booke, verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth that lampreies do engender with ſerpents, which <hi>Plinie</hi> holdeth for a fable, notwithſtanding that hee often ſeemeth to be much delighted in writing of fables. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> alſo writeth, out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of one <hi>Andreas,</hi> that theſe Lampreies which are bred of the viper, if they bite, the wound is deadly, which opinion he afterward reclaimeth as falſe.) Againe he telleth of a Pike that lying vpon the drie land, which when a fox aſſaied to catch, one of his feetſtooke faſt in his teeth; and both were found dead. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his ſecond booke, chap. 107. teſtifieth that once this whole Lake did burne.</p>

            <p>The city of <hi>Siena,</hi> ſaith he, is ſo ancient, that of his firſt beginning there is nothing to be found in any approued old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For that ſome do report it to haue beene built by the <hi>Galli Senones,</hi> which vnder the conduct of <hi>Breanus</hi> their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, about 363. yeares after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the ſpace of ſeuen moneths (as <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> haue recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) wan the city, it cannot be proued out of any good authour. For <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> which firſt broached this opinion, (who for that he intituled his hiſtory by the name of <hi>Polycraticon,</hi> is therefore called <hi>Polycrates,</hi> or of others <hi>Polycarpus,</hi>) in the ſeuenteenth chapter of his ſixth booke, bringeth no authority for this his aſſertion. And himſelfe confeſſeth in the twenty and fourth chapter of his eighth booke, that he was not familiarly known to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth. Now it is apparant to all the world that <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth ſate in the Papall ſeat, but from the yeare of Chriſt, 1154. vnto the yeare 1159. and therefore the teſtimony of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Saleſbury,</hi> concerning the building of <hi>Siena,</hi> ſo many yeares before he was borne, is of no validity at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in his twentieth booke of his Annales, calleth this city <hi>Colonia Senenſis.</hi> Which words of his can by no meanes be vnderſtood of the other <hi>Sena,</hi> (which at this day alſo is in the country <hi>Piceno,</hi> and is vulgarly called <hi>Senegallia,</hi>) as ſome haue fondly imagined. For in the time of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> that city of <hi>Piceno,</hi> was not euer called <hi>Sena,</hi> but <hi>Senogallia,</hi> or <hi>Senogallica,</hi> or <hi>Senogallia,</hi> as is moſt manifeſt out of the words of <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey.</hi> For <hi>Plinie</hi> reckoneth <hi>Coloniam Senenſem,</hi> amongſt the mid land Colonies of <hi>Hetruria;</hi> and not many lines after he placeth <hi>Senagallia</hi> in the ſixth region of <hi>Italie. Ptolemey</hi> not only in the Latine copies printed, but alſo in moſt ancient manuſcript Greeke copies, placeth <hi>Sena</hi> amongſt the mid-land cities of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> but <hi>Sena Gallica,</hi> (for ſo he termeth it) amongſt the cities of the <hi>Senones,</hi> neere <hi>Ancona</hi> and the Temple of Fortune.</p>

               <p>The Mount Apennine in this place hangeth ouer this country with craggy topps exceeding high, in which is that huge caue that they call <hi>Sibyllas caue,</hi> (in their language <hi>Grotta de la Sibylla</hi>) and which the poets faine to be the <hi>Elyſian fields.</hi> For the common people do dreame of one <hi>Sibylla</hi> to be in this caue, which heere poſſeſſeth a large kingdome full of gorgeous buildings and Princely palaces, beſet with pleaſant gardens, abounding with many fine wanton wenches and all maner of pleaſures and delights: all which ſhe will beſtow vpon them, which through this caue (which is alwaies open) will go vnto her: and after they haue been there the ſpace of one whole yeare, they haue free liberty giuen them by <hi>Sibylla,</hi> (if they pleaſe) to depart, and from that time, being returned vnto vs, they affirme that they liue for the reſt of their time, a moſt bleſſed and happy life. This caue is knowne alſo to our countrie-men by the name of <hi>Vrow Venus bergh,</hi> that is, The Lady <hi>Venus</hi> mount. Whereupon they vulgarly ſing certaine Dutch rimes of one little <hi>Daniel</hi> (for ſo the ballad calleth him) who after that he had liued a whole yeare in this caue, at laſt it repented him of this kind of life, therefore heere he leauing his Loue departeth, goeth to <hi>Rome,</hi> commeth to the Pope, confeſſeth his ſinne, and deſireth to be abſolued. The Pope not deeming the ſinne to be veniall, the ſtaffe which by chance he had in his hand, (withered and drie) ſticking it into the ground, ſaid, that his ſinnes ſhould then be pardoned when this ſtaffe ſhall beare Roſes. <hi>Daniel</hi> by this anſweare deſpairing of his ſaluation, went away very heauy and diſcontent, and preſently taking two of his nephewes, his ſiſters ſonnes with him, returneth againe vnto his Paramour. Within three daies after the ſtaffe was obſerued to put forth bloſſomes: <hi>Daniel</hi> was ſought for vp and down, but could no where be found: For they do beleeue that he ſpent the reſt of his life in this caue. But the ſtory of this ballade is a worthy matter for a poeticall head, and to be deemed as true as the reſt of their fictions.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> there is a prouince which they call <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> the Latines anciently named it, <hi>Aprutium:</hi> why it was ſo called, as it is vncertaine, ſo, that it tooke not his name of the <hi>Brutij,</hi> as ſome haue been of opinion, I make no queſtion. Some there are which thinke it ſo named <hi>ab Apris</hi> of Bores, for that the country being foreſty and full of woods, it ſwarmeth with wild hogges: other ſome do deriue it <hi>ab aſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate montis Apenini,</hi> from the craggineſſe of the mount <hi>Apeninus,</hi> which heere in this tract is very hideous, ſteep and high. The greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of writers do beleeue that in it ſome part of the ancient name of <hi>Praetutiana</hi> doth as yet remaine. For <hi>Volaterranus, Blondus, Domi.

It is bounded at this day on the North ſide, by the Hadriaticke ſea: on the Weſt, by the riuer <hi>Tronto,</hi> anciently called <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entum:</hi> on the Eaſt, by <hi>Fortoro,</hi> in old time named <hi>Frento:</hi> vpon the South it hath the mount <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penine,</hi> although in ſome places it ſtretcheth it ſelfe beyond the ſame. This prouince <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the ſtout, king of <hi>Arragon,</hi> diuided into two parts, <hi>Abruzzo</hi> the neather, and <hi>Abruzzo</hi> the higher. <hi>Abruzzo</hi> the higher which we haue deſcribed apart by it ſelfe, is ſeuered from the Neather by the riuer <hi>Peſcara,</hi> which old writers called <hi>Aternus. Scipio Mazella</hi> in his curious deſcription of the kingdome of Naples, affirmeth that this country is by ſituation and nature of the place very ſtrong, and inhabited by a ſtout and ſturdy nation; and the ſoile is very fertile of wines and cattell. The chiefe cities of it are, <hi>Aquila, Interamna</hi> or <hi>Teramo, Amatrice, Atri, Pinne:</hi> and long ſince heere haue ſtoode <hi>Amiterno,</hi> and <hi>Furconio,</hi> both now defaced, yet of their ruines and aſhes is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Aquila</hi> ſome fiue miles off, built vpon the toppe of an hill, as <hi>Volateran</hi> and others haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. This city is ſeated in a place moſt fertile of all maner of things neceſſary: ſo that the Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badges heere (<hi>cauli capucei,</hi> they call them) do often weigh, as <hi>Mazella</hi> reporteth, ſometime thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſometime fortie pound; and therefore <hi>Martiall</hi> ſaid not amiſſe, <hi>Nos amiternus ager felicibus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducathortis;</hi> In <hi>Amiternoes</hi> fertile fields we liue and ſpend our daies. The fields before this citie, do yeeld ſuch great plenty of Saffron, that thereof yearely they make 40000. ducates. Heere is once a yeare kept a great Faire. It hath 110. Churches. Neere this city, as <hi>Blondus</hi> ſaith, is a ſtone, from vnder the which runneth a ſtreame of oile, which they call Oile of peter, or <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum:</hi> and is deſired and ſought for of many, but of the Almaines and Hungarians it is more eſteemed, then of the Italians. The ſame authour recordeth that the country people ſhewed him a Peare-tree growing vpon an hill not farre from the head of the riuer <hi>Peſcara</hi> or <hi>Aterno,</hi> ſhooting vp in ſuch a ſort, that the water falling vpon it, diuideth it ſelfe into three parts, which become three great riuers, <hi>Velino, Tronto</hi> and <hi>Peſcara,</hi> running three diuers waies. <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terno,</hi> in former times a goodly city, famous in hiſtories, and the natiue country of <hi>Saluſt</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hiſtorian, can hardly be diſcerned where it ſtood: yet <hi>Blondus</hi> ſaith, that they do yet ſhew ſome pieces of the Theater, Temples, and Turrets. <hi>Mazella</hi> affirmeth that there yet do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine the Temple of <hi>Saturne,</hi> the tombe of <hi>Druſus</hi> daughter, and a triumph of the Samnites engrauen in marble, a memoriall of their happie victory obtained againſt the Roman army, <hi>ad furcas Caudinas. Teramo</hi> long ſince called <hi>Interamnia,</hi> for that it is ſituate between three riuers, <hi>Fiumicello, Trontino</hi> and <hi>Vitiole,</hi> is the head city of this prouince; whoſe Biſhop is graced with many titles and dignities, and the lord of the ſoile is called by the name of the Duke of <hi>Teramo. Adria</hi> the ancient colonie of the Romanes, is now called <hi>Atri.</hi> Some do thinke that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Hadrian</hi> was borne heere, and of it tooke his name, as alſo the Hadriaticke ſea, now called <hi>Mare ſuperum,</hi> the higher ſea, the Gulfe or Bay of <hi>Venice. Furconium</hi> ſometime hath been a famous Biſhopricke, whoſe Biſhops are often mentioned in the Councels and Synods held 800. yeares ſince, at <hi>Rome</hi> or other places of <hi>Italie.</hi> At this day only ſome ſmall mention is to be ſeen of it: for it was deſtroied by the Lombardes, and the Biſhops ſea, was by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth, from thence tranſlated vnto <hi>Aquila.</hi> The arms of this country, as <hi>Scipio Mazella</hi> writeth, is an Eagle argent crowned, ſtanding vpon three mounts ore, in a field <hi>Azure.</hi> He that deſireth to vnderſtand more of this country let him repaire to the forenamed Authours, who I doubt not will ſatisfie him to the full.</p>

The buildings either of Churches or priuate citizens houſes are moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſtately, with diuers Caſtles and Towers almoſt inuincible. But amongſt the reſt, the houſe of the Duke of <hi>Grauina,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> do farre excell. The ſtreets of the city are very faire and ſtraight. There are foure Courts, which they call Seats, <hi>Capuana, Nida, Montana,</hi> and <hi>S. Georgio,</hi> where the Princes, Dukes, Marqueſſes, and other of the Nobility do meet to conſult of waighty matters and publike buſineſſes. The ſtrong Caſtels are theſe; <hi>Caſtello nouo,</hi> which <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the firſt raiſed and entrenched with very great charges and expences, ſo that now it may be accounted one of the moſt defencible fortification of all <hi>Europe.</hi> Next to this is <hi>Caſtello Capuano;</hi> which now is emploied for place of meeting for the ſtate in conſultation, for matters of the kingdome and city: Then is, <hi>Caſtellum oui,</hi> a little diſtance without the city, ſtanding vpon a rocke (the ancients called it <hi>Meagrum</hi>) compaſſed round with the ſea. Beſide theſe is <hi>Caſtellum Santemerenſe,</hi> vpon a cliffe, looking ouer the walls of the city, lately fortified very ſtrongly by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. Without the wals, vpon the South ſide of the city, there is a Block-houſe in the ſea, a worke of wonderfull art and cunning workemanſhip, built for the defence and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Hauen, continually full with ſhippes almoſt from all quarters of the world. Heere alſo is an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie where all maner of Arts and Liberall Sciences are taught and profeſſed, vnto which there is great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſtudents from all places of the kingdome. Thus farre <hi>Vbertus Folietta,</hi> in a Treatiſe of his, which he wrote and intituled <hi>Brumanum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without the wals of this moſt ſtately city, there are moſt pleaſant ſweet fields, yeelding all maner of things neceſſarie, not onely for the maintainance of man and beaſt, but alſo ſuch as ſerue for pleaſure and delight: Eſpeciallie with all maner of Corne and Graine, and of rich and ſtrong Wine ſuch plenty, that he that hath not ſeene the great ſtore both of Corne and Wine that one Aker of ground doth yeeld, may hardlie be made to beleeue it. The Hilles and Mountaines in this place are very fertile, and full of moſt excellent fruits: and ſome of them, encloſing the lowly plaines in manner of a Theater, do affoord plentie of Deere and game for the Nobilitie. Moreouer about <hi>Naples</hi> are moſt pleaſant and fine Orchards, planted with Medicinall plants, and ſuch like goodlie fruite trees, euerie where reſounding with a moſt ſweet noiſe of brookes and ſtreames running to and fro: euery where moſt fragrant and odoriferous ſmelles do offer themſelues vnto your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuch is the abundance of Myrtill, Laurell, Gelſemine, Roſemarie, Roſe-trees, &amp;c. in euerie corner. To be ſhort, the beauty, delightſomneſſe, and elegancie of all places round about is ſuch, as it doth almoſt exceed the capacitie of mans witte: no man need to wonder why in former times, as well as now, the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſo much delighted to dwell heere. This we haue taken out of <hi>Leander,</hi> where manie other things may be read of, who hath deſcribed the whole kingdome, this Citie, and the Liberties thereof, very curiouſlie, that indeed it is not neceſſarie to ſend the Reader vnto any other Authour but <hi>Scipio Mazzella,</hi> (which in a ſeuerall and peculiar Treatiſe, hath with extraordinarie paines, and diligence, ſet out, in the Italian Tongue, a deſcription of this kingdome.

The cities of this country, long ſince more famous, were, <hi>Tarentum,</hi> now <hi>Taranto,</hi> proudly ſeated between two ſeas exceedingly ſtored with fiſh, in forme ſomewhat like a long Iland.

It is very ſtrong and round beſet with high cliffes; from the maine land there is only one entrance, in the which is a very ſtrong Caſtell. <hi>Hydruntum,</hi> of them called <hi>Otranto,</hi> is the chiefe city, and (which is ſomewhat more,) Metropolitan of the whole <hi>Peninſula,</hi> or Demi-ile, and that not without cauſe: for whether you reſpect the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it, the vertue and humanity of the citizens, ioined with valour and great magnanimity, it hath euer been of them accounted for a very famous and worthy city. It hath a very good and capacious hauen, but againſt the raging blaſts of the North wind not ſo ſafe. It was ſometime very ſtrong and defencible, but now it lieth almoſt leuell with the ground. The fields adioining are very fruitfull; full of ſprings and alwaies green. From hence <hi>Montes Cerauni,</hi> certaine hills of <hi>Epirus,</hi> (now called <hi>Cimera</hi> and <hi>Canina</hi>) may eaſily be deſcried.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Abriel Barrius Franciſcanus</hi> hath very curiouſly deſcribed <hi>Calabria</hi> in fiue bookes: which are imprinted at <hi>Rome</hi> with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heedfull diligence. Out of him we haue culled theſe particulars following: CALABRIA, ſaith he, a country of <hi>Italie,</hi> in forme and faſhion not much vnlike a tongue, lieth between the vpper and neather ſeas. It beginneth at the neather ſea, (the Greeks call it the <hi>Tyrrhen</hi> ſea, the Latines the Mediterran or Mid-land ſea,) from the riuer <hi>Talao,</hi> which runneth into the Bay of <hi>Policaſtro:</hi> at the vpper ſea (the <hi>Ionian</hi> ſea, the Grecians terme it) from the riuer <hi>Siris</hi> (otherwiſe ſometime cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Senno</hi>) and coaſteth along vntill it come to the ſtreights of <hi>Faro di Meſſano,</hi> and the city <hi>Regio:</hi> and ſo being diuided longwiſe by the mount <hi>Apennine</hi> (heere they call it <hi>Aſpro monte</hi>) it endeth in two capes or promontories, the one called <hi>Leucopetra,</hi> (of them <hi>Capo de Leocopetra</hi>) the other <hi>Lacinium</hi> (vulgarly of them called <hi>Cabo delle colonne,</hi> or <hi>Cabo dell' Alice.</hi>) Not only the plaines and champions, but euen the hillie places, like vnto <hi>Latium</hi> or <hi>Campania,</hi> are well ſerued with water. Whatſoeuer is neceſſary for the maintainance of mans life, this country doth yeeld in great abundance, it needeth no forraine commodities, but is able to liue of it ſelfe. <hi>Calabria</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is a good and a fertile ſoile, it is not combred with Fennes, Lakes or Bogges, but is alwaies green, affoording good paſtorage for cattell, and excellent ground for all ſorts of graine. The fountaines and brooks are many, and thoſe paſſing cleare and wholeſome. The ſunnie hills and mountaines, open to euery coole blaſt of wind, are wonderfull fertile for corne, vines, and trees of diuers kinds, whereof ariſe great profit to the inhabitants. The valleies are pleaſant and fruitfull. The ſhady groues and woods do affoord many pleaſures and delights. The goodly meddowes and paſtures are richly decked with herbs, and ſweet-ſmelling flowres, and euer-running ſtreames. And amongſt other, heere is great plenty of Medicke fodder, wherewith they feed and fatte their cattell. Heere alſo grow many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent phyſicke hearbs of ſoueraigne vertues againſt diuers and ſundrie diſeaſes. It bringeth forth diuers plants, as the Plane tree, <hi>Vitex</hi> or <hi>Agnus caſtus,</hi> the Turpentine tree, the Oliue tree, <hi>Siliqua Silueſtris,</hi> Arbute or Strawberry tree, wild Saffron, Madder, Liquiriſe, Tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra or Sowbread. It hath alſo ſome hoate baths, continually diſtilling from their fountaines, which do cure aches and many other like maladies. In diuers places there are ſprings of ſalt water, whereof they make a kind of brine or pickle. It is well watered with many fine riuers, and thoſe ſtored with ſundrie ſorts of freſh fiſh. The ſea alſo on ech ſide yeeldeth great plenty of fiſh, both tunies, ſword-fiſhes, and lampreies. There in many places is found the beſt Corall, both white and redde. Heere is moſt pleaſant hunting and hawking: for in theſe quarters diuers and ſundrie ſorts of wild beaſts do lodge; and as many birds and fowles do breed and build: wild boares, harts, hindes, goates, hares, foxes, lynces, otters, ſquerrells, martens, badgers, ferrets, porkupines, tortuſes, both of the waters and of the mountaines. Of fowles, pheſants, partridges, quailes, wood-cocks, ring-doues, crowes, &amp;c. as alſo of many kinds of hawks it is euery where full. It maintaineth ſome herds of cattell and flocks of ſheep and goats. It breedeth excellent horſes, very ſwift and of great ſtomacke. Mettals heere were found in old time, and now alſo it aboundeth at this day with diuers kinds of mineralls: hauing indeed euery where mines of gold, ſiluer, iron, ſalt, marble, alablaſter, cryſtall, marchaſite, red-lead, or vermillion, copperas, alume, brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone &amp;c. many kinds of corne, wheat, ſiligo, beerbarly, rie, trimino, (we call it, I thinke, Turky wheat) barly, riſe, and of ſeſamum infinite ſtore. It aboundeth alſo with all kind of pulſe, (<hi>legumina</hi> the Latines call them,) oile, wine and hony, and thoſe in their kinds the beſt. There are heere euery where orchards thicke ſet with oranges, limons, and pome cittron trees. Heere alſo is made great plenty of excellent ſilke, farre better then any kind of ſilke made in other places of <hi>Italie.</hi> The Cotton tree <hi>(Goſsipium,)</hi> groweth heere plentifully. But what ſhall I ſpeake of the kind temperature of the aire? For heere the fields both winter and ſummer are continuallie green. But aboue all things, there is nothing that doth argue the ſame more ſoundly then that airy dew or heauenly hony, which they call <hi>Manna,</hi> that euery where diſtilleth from aboue, and is heere gathered in great abundance. So that that which the Iſraelites in the wildernes did admire and hold for a ſtrange wonder, heere kind nature doth affoord of her own accord. It is adorned alſo with many goodly market towns, where marts and faires are kept at certaine times of the yeare. Heere in ſome places ſtill is obſerued the ancient cuſtome of the Romanes vſed at funerals and buriall of the dead, where a chiefe mourner (<hi>Praefica,</hi> they called her) is hired to go before the reſt of the mourners and ſhe to guide their mournefull ditties and to keepe time in their howling lamentations. The funerall being done and all ceremonies performed, the dead mans friends and kindred, bringing their meat and iunkets, do banquet altogether at the dead mans houſe. The women of this country naturally, for modeſty, and for that the waters of theſe places are good and wholeſome, drinke naught but water. It is a ſhame for any women to drinke wine, except ſhe be very old, or be in child-bed, &amp;c.

In <hi>Plinies</hi> time there were 72. cities: at this day they report it to containe twelue Biſhopricks, of great iuriſdiction and large dioceſſes.

The ſame authour doth affirme, (which <hi>Strabo</hi> alſo doth approue,) that all theſe ſometime were cut off from the maine continent, and to haue been part of the cape <hi>Miſeno.</hi> This doth the forenamed <hi>Pontanus</hi> in his ſixth booke confirme, in theſe words: That <hi>Aenaria,</hi> ſaith he, was cutte off, from the maine continent, many things do demonſtrate: namely, The torne rocks, The hollow ground full of caues, The nature of the ſoile, like vnto that of the continent, leane, drie, and ſpuing out hotte ſprings and fountaines.

But this opinion the ſame <hi>Erythraeus</hi> in the foreſaid place laboureth to ouerthrow, as not altogether conſonant to the truth, for that of tunnes made for this purpoſe, he proteſteth that he hath not read of in any authour whatſoeuer. Yet <hi>Seruius</hi> in my iudgement ſeemeth vpon the forcited 6. of <hi>Virgils</hi> Aeneads, to ſtand for <hi>Pliny,</hi> where he ſaith, that by <hi>Cumae</hi> there was a certaine place named <hi>Doliola,</hi> that is, if we ſhould interpret it, <hi>Tunnes.</hi> And it is more likely, that this Iland ſhould take the name from that place, with which ſometime it was vnited, according to the opinion of theſe good authours, rather then of apes, (for I regard not the fable of <hi>Ouid</hi>) of which beaſts none are heere, or euer were. That this Iland from the beginning hath been ſubiect to earth-quakes, flames of fire, and hot waters from thence oft breaking out, we are certified by <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny.</hi> The mountaine which <hi>Strabo</hi> calleth <hi>Epomeus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny Epopos,</hi> now they call it S. <hi>Nicolas mount,</hi> which for the ſame cauſe they report to haue burned inwardly at the bottome: and being ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with an earthquake to haue ſomtimes caſt out great flakes of fire. Heere hence aroſe that fable of <hi>Typhon</hi> the giant, (wherof you may read in <hi>Homer, Virgill, Silius Italicus,</hi> (who calleth him <hi>Iapetus) Lucane</hi> and others) as the ſame <hi>Strabo</hi> interpreteth, which they fable to lie vnderneath this hill, and to breath out fire and water. That it is on euery ſide wonderfully fertile, of the laſt writers, <hi>Io. Elyſius, Fran. Lombardus, Io. Pontanus, Solenander, Andreas Baccius,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Iaſolinus</hi> the authour of this map, hath ſhewed abundantly: who in it doth reckon vp, beſide the 18. naturall bathes which others haue written of 35. other, firſt diſcouered by himſelfe. The ſame author alſo beſide theſe baths doth make mention of 19. ſtoues or hot houſes, (<hi>fumarolas</hi> they call them) and 5. medicinall ſands, ſoueraigne in Phyſick for the drying vp of raw humours. Of this fire heere in the bowels of the earth, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his booke of the Miracles of Nature, affirmeth that heere are certaine ſtoues, which do burne with fierie kind of force and exceeding feruent heate, and yet neuer do burſt out into flames: But <hi>Elyſius, Pandulphus</hi> and <hi>Pontanus</hi> do report the contrary. There is a place in this Iland <hi>Iſchia,</hi> about a mile from the city of the ſame name, which, of the raging fire that happened heere in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> II in the yeare 1301. is at this day called <hi>Cremate.</hi> For heere the bowels of the earth cleauing in ſunder, by the flaſhing fire that flamed out, a great part of it was ſo conſumed, that a ſmall village being firſt burnt down, was at the laſt vtterly ſwallowed vp. And caſting vp into the aire huge ſtones, intermedled with ſmoke, fire, and duſt, which falling againe by their own force and violence, ſcattered heere and there vpon the ground, made a moſt fertile and pleaſant iland, waſt and deſolate. This fire continued the ſpace of two moneths, ſo that many, both men and beaſts were by it deſtroied: and many ſhipping themſelues &amp; their goods forced to flie either to the ilands neere adioining, or to the maine continent. Yet this iland for many things is very fruitfull: for in it there are excellent good wines and thoſe of diuerſe kinds, as that which they call Greeks wine, Latine, Sorbinio and <hi>Cauda caballi.</hi> It beareth good corn about S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> mount. In it the Cedar, the pomecitron, and the Quince tree, do grow euery where moſt plentifully. Alume and Brimſtone are found deep within the earth: it hath had long ſince ſome veines of gold, as <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Elyſius</hi> haue written, and now hath as <hi>Iaſolinus</hi> affirmeth. About the hill, (commonly called <hi>Monte Ligoro</hi>) there is great ſtore of pheſants, hares, conies, and other wild beaſts: neere the cape of S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> they take much fiſh, and withall find much Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Not farre from thence is the hauen <hi>Ficus</hi> or <hi>Fichera,</hi> where the water boileth ſo hot, that in it fleſh or fiſh are ſodden in a ſhort time, and yet notwithſtanding it is of a pleaſant taſt and very ſauory. There is a fountaine which they call <hi>Nitroli,</hi> in which this is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that beſides his great vertues for the cure of certaine diſeaſes, if you ſhall lay flax in it, within three daies at the moſt it will make it as white as ſnow. Whereupon the authour of this Table ſaith, that this ile for bigneſſe, good aire, fertility of ſoile, mines of mettall, ſtrong wines, doth far ſurpaſſe the other 25. ilands which are in the bay of <hi>Naples.</hi> Betweene the foreland called <hi>Acus,</hi> the needle, and that other named <hi>Cephalino,</hi> there is a great caue, or ſafe harborough for ſhips, eſpecially for pinnaces &amp; thoſe leſſer ſorts of ſhips. Heere it is like that <hi>Aeneas</hi> landed, of which <hi>Ouid</hi> ſpeaketh: as alſo <hi>Pompey,</hi> when as he ſailed from <hi>Sicilia</hi> to <hi>Puteoli,</hi> whereof <hi>Appian</hi> writeth in his 5. booke of Ciuill wars. In this ſame Iland ouer againſt <hi>Cumae,</hi> there is a lake in which there is continually great plenty of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mews or Fenducks (<hi>Larus</hi> or <hi>Fulica</hi>) theſe are very gainfull and profitable to the inhabitants. The words of <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaking of this iland are worth the noting. In the ſame, ſaith he, a whole town did ſinke: and at another time by an earthquake the firme land became a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding poole, <hi>ſtagnum</hi> he calleth it: (although that the ancient printed copies for <hi>ſtagnum</hi> haue <hi>ſtatinas;</hi> in which place the learned <hi>Scaliger</hi> had rather read <hi>ſtatiuas,</hi> meaning ſtanding waters.) The ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> hath left in record, that if one heere ſhall cut down a Cedar tree, yet it will ſhoot forth and bud againe. <hi>Liuy</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Chalcidenſes</hi> of <hi>Euboea</hi> did firſt inhabit this iland: yet <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith they were the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrienſes.</hi> But theſe alſo came from the ile <hi>Euboea.</hi> I am of opinion that <hi>Athenaeus</hi> in his 9 booke, although he nameth it not, yet he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this iland, which he affirmeth he ſaw, (as he ſailed from <hi>Dicaearchia</hi> vnto <hi>Naples</hi>) inhabited by a few men, but full of copies. There is alſo neere vnto this, <hi>Prochyta,</hi> an iland ſo named, not of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his nurſe, but becauſe it was <hi>profuſa ab Aenaria,</hi> ſeuered from <hi>Aenaria,</hi> or as <hi>Strabo</hi> in his 5. booke affirmeth from <hi>Pithecuſae.</hi> Notwithſtanding in his I. booke he writeth that it was ſundered from <hi>Miſeno:</hi> yet both may be true: for aſwell this, as that by inundations and tempeſtuous ſtorms were rent off from the maine land. The poets ſame that <hi>Minas</hi> the giant lieth vnder this Iland, as <hi>Typhon</hi> doth vnder <hi>Iſchia.</hi> Of which <hi>Horace</hi> in his 3. booke of Poems writeth to <hi>Calliope. Andreas Baccius</hi> writeth thus of this ile; It is a little ile, ſaith he, but very pleaſant, rich of mettals and hot bathes, notwithſtanding for the continuall fires, which the continuall tides of the ſea do kindle in it, as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, it neuer was much inhabited. It retaineth ſtill the ancient name; for they now call it <hi>Procida.</hi> Of this iland you may read more in <hi>Scipio Mazella,</hi> in his additions vnto the tract of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſius</hi> of the Bathes of <hi>Puteoli.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Reta,</hi> which now they call <hi>Candia,</hi> is bigger then <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but leſſer then <hi>Sicilia,</hi> or <hi>Sardinia:</hi> vnto which ilands only in the Mediterran ſea it is inferiour. Yet for worth and fertility it is equall to the beſt. Ancient Hiſtoriographers do affirme that once it was famous for one hundred cities, and therefore was called <hi>Hecatompolis.</hi> In the time of <hi>Pliny</hi> it had not aboue forty. At this day, as <hi>P. Bellonius</hi> teſtifieth it hath not aboue three of any account, that is, <hi>Candy,</hi> a colonie of the Venetians, (whereof the whole iland is now named,) <hi>Canea</hi> and <hi>Rhetimo.</hi> The compaſſe of the iland is about 520. miles. It is euery where full of mountaines and hils, and therefore the inhabitants are much giuen to hunting. There is in it neuer a riuer that is nauigable, nor any venemous or hurtfull beaſt. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wine, which they heere call <hi>Maluaſia,</hi> and is from hence tranſported almoſt into all countries, hath made this iland famous all the world ouer. This kind of wine old writers called <hi>Pramnium,</hi> as <hi>Bellonius</hi> recordeth. <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terran</hi> is of opinion that it is called <hi>Maluiſia,</hi> for <hi>Aruiſia,</hi> by the addition of one letter. And he furthermore addeth, that that kind of vine was firſt brought into <hi>Creta</hi> from the cape <hi>Aruiſium</hi> in the ile <hi>Chios,</hi> (now <hi>Scio</hi>) and therefore the wines were called <hi>vina aruiſia.</hi> Heere is great ſtore of <hi>Cypreſſe</hi> trees, (whereof they make their ſhips,) which are of ſuch great height, as <hi>Dom. Niger</hi> reporteth, that it is a moſt goodly fight to behold. In this iland was the Maze or Labyrinth built by <hi>Daedalus</hi> after the patterne, as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, of that in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> A mention of which, as <hi>George Alexander,</hi> the Lieutenant of this iland for the Venetians, affirmeth in <hi>Volaterran,</hi> do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnto this day.</p>
            <p>There is a mountaine, ſaith he, cut through, hollow euery way with many windings and turnings, and hath one onely narrow and ſtraite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. The guide, a man that well knoweth the place, goeth before with a burning torch, directing the way in and out, and ſhewing the ſtrange cranks in the darke corners. But <hi>Peter Bellone,</hi> a curious ſearcher of ancient monuments and antiquities, and one that in our age diligently viewed this iland, ſaith that this in old time was a quarry of ſtone, not a Labyrinth. (Notwithſtanding that the people of the country do ſo call it) which indeed is more probable, ſeeing that <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth that in his time there remained no ſigne of it. But of this place take this deſcription of <hi>P. Bellone,</hi> There is a place between <hi>Gnoſium</hi> and <hi>Cortina,</hi> which hauing been obſerued to be verie conuenient for the cutting and digging out of ſtone, the country people made there a Stone-mine <hi>(lapidicinam)</hi> out of which when as many ſtones were digged there were many windings and turnings left, ſo that he which by himſelfe will venture to go vp and downe in this ſtone-pit, he ſhall light vpon many crooks and by-waies, and may eaſily looſe himſelfe. Neere to the riuer <hi>Leth,</hi> is this falſly-ſuppoſed-labyrinth, the which if any be deſirous to ſee, he muſt needs vſe the help of ſome one or other of the country people of the next village, to go in before him with candle to guide and direct him. But in it ſuch a number of Battes do lodge, that except a man do take great heed they will by their flying vp and downe, put out the candle with their wings. In the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the pitte are found great heaps of Battes dong, and their little yong ones yet hanging vpon the ſides and wals. The dammes when they can no longer flie, do not cleaue and ſticke to the wall, nor ſtand vpon their feet, but there they hang vpon the beams and rafters, as our Battes do in the clifts of timber and holes of walles. Thus farre <hi>Bellonius.</hi> (The like ſtory vnto this, altogether as <hi>Bellonius</hi> reporteth it, in my mind I haue ſeen, when as for recreation I trauelled from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> and in my iourney at the hauen of <hi>Traiane</hi> I went vnder the ground, firſt hiring mine hoſt to go before me with a light, that I might view the ruines of the ſame.) It was anciently dedicated to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> becauſe that heere, old folks did thinke, he was bred, and brought vp, and at length buried. <hi>Bordonius</hi> affirmeth that vpon the North ſide of this iland there is a great caue vnderneath the earth, made by the labour and induſtrie of man, forty cubites in length, and foure in breadth: which at this day they call <hi>Iupiters tombe,</hi> and that vpon the head of it yet to this day his Epitaph remaineth written in great Capitall letters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth that the people haue been long ſince accounted for the beſt Mariners, as being wholly inuironed with the ſea: and from thence aroſe that by-word, <hi>Cretenſis mare neſcit,</hi> A Cretian hath no skill in ſailing. They haue of old been very infamous for their leuity, deceit, lying, and other ſuch like vices: Heere hence ſprong theſe prouerbs, <hi>Cretiza cum Cretenſi, Cretenſis Cretenſem, Cretenſis cum Aeginate, E Creta raptus. &amp;c.</hi> of which thou maiſt read in <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Chiliades. Wherefore they are alſo ill reported of by S. <hi>Paul</hi> for the ſame faults. But I feare me leaſt that which hath commonly been ſpoken of the Cretian, may indeed be truly verified of many other Nations, nay I would to God that all Nations whereſoeuer all the world ouer were not in this of kinne to the Cretians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>L. Caecilius Metellus Creticus</hi> firſt brought this iland vnder the command of the Romans, about the yeare 685. after the building of <hi>Rome:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it was ſubiect to the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> Then it was giuen to <hi>Bonifacius</hi> of <hi>Monteferrato:</hi> by whom it was ſold to the Venetians, in the yeare of Chriſt 1194. to whom at this day it doth belong. Amongſt the ancient Geographers <hi>Strabo</hi> hath curiouſly deſcribed this iland: Amongſt the latter writers <hi>Domi. Niger, Volaterran, Vadian, Zieglerus,</hi> and <hi>Bened. Bordonius,</hi> haue done the like. But moſt excellently of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and exactly <hi>Iodocus Ghiſtelius</hi> in his iourney to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Bellonius</hi> in his obſeruations. <hi>Iodocus à Meggen,</hi> alſo hath ſomething of this Iland, in his Peregrination to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> worth the obſeruation and reading. We are beholding to that braue nobleman, The Honourable <hi>Sign. Franciſco Superantia,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> not only a louer of the Mathematicks and earneſt ſtudent of Geographie, but a worthy eſteemer of all maner of learning.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Aegaean</hi> ſea (now called <hi>Archipelago</hi>) conteineth many ilands, as the <hi>Cyclades, Sporades</hi> and diuers others, of which, ſome of the chiefe we haue deſcribed in this plotte. NEGROPONTE, ſometime called <hi>Eubooea:</hi> his chiefe city then was called <hi>Chalcis,</hi> now they call it <hi>Negroponte,</hi> whereof the whole iland tooke the name. It was not long ſince wholly ſubiect vnto the Venetians: from whom it was taken by the Turks about the yeare of Chriſt 1471. It yeeldeth great plenty of oile, corne and wine, and is of all things that the earth bringeth forth, very fertile, eſpecially it affoordeth very good wood for the making of ſhippes and gallies, as <hi>Anonymus</hi> reporteth, who wrote of the ſacking and taking of it. The inhabitants (which is almoſt generally true in all the iles of this ſea) are partly Greeks, and partly Turks: but each vſeth his owne language and religion. NICSIA, in old time <hi>Naxos,</hi> is accounted one of the moſt fertile ilands of this ſea. It yeeldeth good ſtore of Wine. Some do thinke that heere is a veine of Gold, but ſuch is the ſlouth and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the people, that yet it is not knowne where about it is. Heere is a kind of Waſpe whoſe ſting they report to be deadly. Heere are very many Battes. It was ſometime belonging to <hi>Iohanni Quirino,</hi> a nobleman of <hi>Venice:</hi> afterward it came into the poſſeſsion of a certaine captaine named <hi>Iacobo Criſpo,</hi> whom <hi>Solimus</hi> the Turke draue from hence. Therefore it is now inhabited by Turks and Iewes.</p>
               <p>SANTORINI, of the ancients called by the name of <hi>Theraſia.</hi> This Iland riſeth by little and little euen from the ſhore vnto the middeſt, vntill it become an high mountaine, vpon whoſe toppe is placed the caſtle <hi>Scaro.</hi> The people for the moſt part liue by fiſhing. This alſo, as the other, is vnder the command of the great Turke. SCIO, the old writers called it <hi>Chios,</hi> is all full of trees and mountaines: it is watered with many ſmall brooks. <hi>Vinum aruiſium,</hi> (they now call it <hi>Maluaſia</hi>) was from hence firſt tranſported into <hi>Candia.</hi> This iland only breedeth the Maſtiche-tree, whoſe gumme from hence is conueied all Chriſtendome ouer. <hi>Andronicus Palaeologus</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> gaue it to the Genowaies, who poſſeſſed it vntill the yeare 1465. when as <hi>Soliman</hi> by a wile gatte it from them. The women of this ile are commended aboue all other for fauour and beauty. Of this you may read in <hi>Laonicus</hi> his tenth booke. RHODVS, ſtill retaineth the ancient name. It hath a city of the ſame name, very ſtrong and defenſible, with a very large and capacious hauen. It is the more famous for the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of the ſunne, a ſtatue or image ſeuentie cubites high, which being broken off at the knees by an earth-quake, was ouerthrown &amp; fell to the ground. Certaine Egyptians, as <hi>Domi. Niger</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, in the time of <hi>Conſtance</hi> the Emperour, paſsing the ſea from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Rhodus,</hi> amongſt other things, ouerthrew this <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> brake it in pieces, and with the braſſe did lade away 900. camels. It was giuen by <hi>Emanuel</hi> Emp. of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> vnto the knights of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which for a long time and often did valiantly defend it againſt the furious aſſaults of the Turks, vntill in the yeare 1522. when as <hi>Solyman</hi> beſieging it round by ſea and land; they were forced to yeeld it vp, and to flie into the ile <hi>Melita.</hi> Of theſe ſee more in <hi>Theodoricus Adamaeus.</hi> STALAMINE, this the Gretians in old time called <hi>Lemnos.</hi> Of it read that which we ſhall write in the deſcription of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> MILO, former ages long ſince cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it <hi>Melos.</hi> In it is a mine of Siluer, where alſo is found the Sardoine, a pretious ſtone. METELLINO, old writers called it <hi>Leſbot.</hi> It hath a city of the ſame name, ſhaken and ruined by an earth-quake. They are vnder the gouernment of the Turke, as the other, yet they retaine their old language and religion. CERIGO, in old time they called it <hi>Cythera.</hi> SCARPANTO, the ancients named it <hi>Carpathus,</hi> or as <hi>Homer</hi> writeth it <hi>Crapathus:</hi> whereupon the ſea about this place was called <hi>Mare Carpathium.</hi> It is ſituate almoſt in the mid-way between <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Rhodus.</hi> It is in compaſſe forty, or as others affirme, fifty miles. <hi>Euſtathius</hi> in his commentaries vpon <hi>Homer,</hi> ſaith that it is craggy and euery where mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and full of hils, and was called <hi>Porphyris</hi> in old time of the great abundance of Purples, (a kind of fiſh, whereof commeth the purple colour) found in this ſea: and <hi>Tetrapolis,</hi> of the foure cities in this iland. From this iland ſprong that prouerbe, <hi>Carpathius leporem,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Euſtathius</hi> deliuereth out of <hi>Iulius Pollux.</hi> It is ſpoken of thoſe which do ſo do a thing, that afterward being done, they do repent them of it. Becauſe theſe Ilanders firſt brought in hares into this country, and within a little while after, when they perceiued how they eat and ſpoiled their corne, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied them againe. It hath many Hauens, but thoſe very narrow, ſhallow and dangerous. The inhabitants do ſpeake the Greeke tongue, and profeſſe the Religion of the Greeke Church, but are ſubiect to the iuriſdiction and gouernment of the Signiory of <hi>Venice.</hi> You may read more of theſe ilands in <hi>Bordonius</hi> and <hi>Porcacchius,</hi> which in the Italian tongue haue written peculiar treatiſes of Ilands.</p>

The Metropolitan or chiefe city is <hi>Nicoſia.

It is inferiour to no Iland that I know: for it yeeldeth plenty of wine and oile: it hath alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient corne to find it ſelfe.

In it doth grow in great plenty, the ſweet cane <hi>(canna mellis)</hi> out of which they do boile Sugar.

There is a kind of ſtuffe made there of goates haire, which now we call <hi>Chamelett,</hi> the Italians <hi>Zambelloto.</hi> This Iland ſendeth ouer diuers commodities into other countries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they yearely raiſe great profit and gaines; it doth not much ſtand in need of any forrein commodities or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe. The aire is not very wholeſome nor healthfull. The people generally do giue themſelues to pleaſures, ſports and voluptuouſneſſe: the women are very wanton, and of light behauiour. The fruitfulneſſe of it is ſo great, that in old time they called it <hi>Macaria,</hi> that is, The Bleſſed Iland; and the laſciuiouſneſſe of the nation ſuch, that vulgarly it was ſuppoſed to haue beene dedicated to <hi>Venus</hi> the Goddeſſe of loue. It is 427. miles about, and 200. long, as <hi>Bordonius</hi> hath recorded. The Venetians do hold it by right of inheritance, and is vnder them gouerned by a Lieutenant or Praetor. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his 16. booke ſaith, that in this iland were nine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cities, which had their ſeuerall petie Kings, by whom they were gouerned; all notwithſtanding ſubiect to the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Inferiour townes alſo were commanded by their proper Kings.</p>
            <p>But that the fertility of this ile may better appeare, I thinke it good to ſet downe that commendation of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus Marcellinus,</hi> which he hath left behind him of it; <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ſaith he, is ſo fertile and aboundeth with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of all things, that without the help of any forrein commodities, only of themſelues it is able to build a ſhip from the keel to the toppe ſaile, and ſend it to the ſea ridged and furniſhed with all things neceſſary whatſoeuer. <hi>Sextus Rufus</hi> alſo hath theſe words of it; <hi>Cyprus;</hi> famous for wealth and great riches, tempted the poore and needy Romanes to inuade it, ſo that we held the poſſeſsion of that iland iniuſtly and rather for gaine, then for any right we had vnto it. But this, ô <hi>Rufus,</hi> is not, as they ſay, mercenary commendation of the Roman valour.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the ancient writers, <hi>Strabo, Mela,</hi> and other Geographers haue deſcribed this Iland: Of the latter, <hi>Benedictus Bordonius</hi> in his treatiſe of Ilands: <hi>Vadianus, Pius</hi> the ſecond Pope of <hi>Rome, Domin. Niger, Sabellicus, Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terran,</hi> and <hi>Iacobus Zieglerus</hi> paſsing well: <hi>Stephanus Luſignanus,</hi> hath in the French tongue written a peculiar booke of this Iland.</p>

On the Eaſt ſide, as <hi>Bellonius</hi> reporteth, it is leane and no good corne ground: between the South and Weſt parts, where it is more moiſt, it is much more fertile. Anciently it had two cities, <hi>Myrina</hi> and <hi>Epheſtias:</hi> this latter is wholly deſert and not inhabited, is now called <hi>Cochino.</hi> That at this day is a towne of ſmall account, ſituate in a Demy-ile or Peninſula, ioined to the Iland by a narrow necke or Iſthmos; at this day it is called <hi>Lemno.</hi> In this iland, as <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifieth, there was a Labyrinth, the third in eſtimation from that of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But <hi>Bellonius</hi> narrowly ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for his foundation, could not find any mention of it: nor any of the country that could ſhew him any more then certaine pieces of it.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reece,</hi> which ſometime was as it were the mother and nurce of all good learning and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, of a rich and wealthy country, and which by his valour and magnanimity was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe &amp; Prince of the better halfe of the world, is at this day driuen to that ſtate (ſuch is the mutability and vnconſtancy of fortune, which turneth all things vpſide downe) that there is no part of it but either it is ſubiect to the Turke and enthralled to his ſlauiſh ſeruitude, or els it is vnder the command of the Venetians, or tributary to them. The Turke poſſeſſeth the greater part: the Venetians do only enioy certaine ilands in that ſea. Thoſe which are vnder the Venetian gouernment are in better ſtate, in reſpect of Religion, than thoſe which are ſubiect to the Turke. Thoſe which are vnder the obedience of the Turke, do conforme themſelues to their maners, as likewiſe thoſe which are commanded of the Venetians; doe imitate the behauiour of the Venetians. Yet all of them do liue in ſuch great darkeneſſe of ignorant blindneſſe, that in all <hi>Greece</hi> now there is not one Vniuerſity or ſchoole of liberall ſciences: neither are they deſirous to haue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren taught ſo much as to write and read. And all of them generally do ſpeake their ancient language, but much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, although ſome of them do ſpeake more purely then others. Yet their moderne language doth come more neere to the old Greeke, then the Italian to the Roman or Latin tongue. Thoſe which dwell in cities ſubiect to the Venetian iuriſdiction, do ſpeake Greeke and Italian: but the country people only Greeke: thoſe which dwell in cities comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Turke, do ſpeake Greeke and the Turkiſh tongues; thoſe in the villages and vpland places, only Greeke. They haue alſo at this day, as (alſo they had in former ages) diuers and different dialects; for the people of one prouince do ſpeake more pure; they of another ſhire more barbarouſly and rudely: whereupon that happeneth to this country, which is incident to other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> that one doth mocke and ſcoffe anothers pronunciation, which to his eares ſeemeth rude and clowniſh: ſo that the Boies of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> do mocke and laugh at the forreners; for their pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation and diuers accenting of words different from them. Much like as the Italian, which ſpeaketh the Tuſcane: or the French which ſpeaketh French: or the Spaniard, which ſpeaketh the Caſtillian languages, do flout and hiſſe at thoſe which are brought vp in other countries of the ſame kingdomes.</p>
            <p>But that we may ſet out in the beſt maner the whole courſe of life of this nation, I thinke it neceſſary to diſtinguiſh the Nobility and citizens from the common people and baſer ſort of men: for they which are of greater reuenews and of better credit, do vſe the habit and faſhion of apparell of thoſe Princes to whom they are ſubiect, ſo that thoſe which are gouerned by the Venetians, do imitate the Venetians: thoſe that are ſubiect to the Turke, the Turkes. But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people vnder whoſe iuriſdiction ſo euer, aſwell within the maine land, as the ilanders, do yet retaine ſomething of the old cuſtomes of the Greeks: for, for the moſt part all of them do weare the haire of their head long behind, and ſhort before: and do vſe great double cappes. The Ilanders in the forme of diuine ſeruice, all of them both in rites and ceremonies, aſwell as in Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, do not any whit vary one from another. All the Greeks general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after the Turkes maner, haue not much houſhold ſtuffe, neither do they lie vpon feather-beds, but in ſteed of them they vſe certaine pillowes, ſtuffed with flocks or wooll. All of them do hate delaied wine, that is, wine mingled with water, and to this day they keepe their old cuſtome of carouſing and liberall kind of drinking, eſpecially the Creets. Yet in this they differ from the Germanes; in that theſe prouoke one another to drinke whole cuppes, thoſe do ſippe and drinke, ſmaller draughts. Whereupon <hi>Graecari,</hi> was then (and now ſtill is) vſed, for <hi>Inebriari,</hi> to be drunken. But becauſe that in drinking they vſe certaine lawes or ceremonies, I cannot paſſe them ouer with ſilence. Firſt, their tables are very low, and they drinke by turnes, no man euer skipping his courſe: ſo that if any man ſhall call for wine out of order, that is, before his turne come about, it is held for a very vnmannerly part. He that can fill wine beſt, holdeth the wine potte, and he alone filleth out for the reſt in order as it commeth to their courſe. In thoſe their drinkings they vſe a certaine little kind of glaſſe without a foote, ſo that it cannot be ſet downe but euery man muſt drinke all out, and may not leaue one drop in the glaſſe. Sometime they challenge one another to drinke after the Dutch faſhion, and then they embrace one another, and hold hands, and one kiſſeth the hand of him to whom he drinketh, and firſt layeth it vpon his forehead, then he ſtroaketh and kiſſeth both his cheeks: but in this kind of drinking they obſerue no order as afore. And becauſe they drinke a very ſtrong wine, and that in ſmall draughts, and ſo do heate themſelues very much, they haue alwaies by them a great tankerd full of water, whereof they drinke euery foote large draughts to coole them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againe: for otherwiſe they ſhould ſcarſely be able to alay their thirſt. No women may be preſent at their drinke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The old cuſtome vſed of the heathen of mourning for the dead, is ſtill obſerued at this day all ouer <hi>Greece,</hi> and countries neere adioining: which is a very fooliſh maner: for as ſoone as one is dead, the women meet together in a certaine place; and at the breake of day they begin a kind of lamentation or howling, ſtriking their breaſts, tearing their cheekes, twiching and pulling their haire, they keep a pitifull and ruefull adoe to ſee to. And that theſe ceremonies may be done more ſolemnely, they hire one woman aboue the reſt with a moſt ſhrill loud voice, to lead the reſt and guide their voices, that their reſts, or pauſes as they call them, and the accents may better be diſtinguiſhed: and in this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſong they ſet out the praiſes and vertuous qualities of the party deceaſſed, from his cradle euen to the laſt houre of his death. &amp;c. Theſe we haue taken out of the firſt booke of <hi>P. Bellonius</hi> his obſeruations, where thou maieſt ſee many things more worth the noting.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the old writers, <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Mela</hi> deſcribed this country, but <hi>Pauſanias</hi> more curiouſly and with greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Llyricum,</hi> or, (which pleaſeth others better) <hi>Illyris,</hi> is a country vpon the coaſt of the Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aticke ſea, oppoſite to <hi>Italy.</hi> The bounds of this prouince according to diuers authours, are diuers. For <hi>Pliny</hi> doth aſſigne it but a narrow roome between the riuers <hi>Arſia</hi> and <hi>Titius.</hi> And <hi>Ptolemey</hi> he extendeth the confines of it as farre, namely from <hi>Hiſtria,</hi> vp as high as <hi>Macedonia,</hi> all along by the ſea coaſt: and his vpland or more inner parts, he maketh to reach euen vnto the skirts of <hi>Pannonia</hi> and <hi>Moeſia</hi> the higher. <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrinus</hi> do yet make it farre greater, aſcribing to <hi>Illyricum</hi> all that tract of the Hadriaticke ſea that is between <hi>Tergeſtum</hi> and <hi>Montes Ceraunij,</hi> and affirmeth withall that the <hi>Illyrij</hi> do dwell beyond the riuer <hi>Danaw.</hi> For <hi>Mela</hi> doth account the riuer <hi>Danaw</hi> amongſt the riuers of <hi>Illyricum. Strabo</hi> alſo in his ſeuenth booke of his Geography, ſaith that the <hi>Illyrij,</hi> do border vpon <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Thracia.</hi> But <hi>Appianus Alexandrinus</hi> doth yet make it more large then any of thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer writers: for thus he writeth of the <hi>Illyrij.</hi> The Greeks, ſaith he, do call all thoſe <hi>Illyrij,</hi> which dwell between <hi>Chao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Theſprotis,</hi> (beyond <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Thracia</hi>) vp as high as the riuer <hi>Iſter:</hi> for this is the length of this prouince. The breadth of it is the ſpace betwixt <hi>Macedonia</hi> and the mountaines of <hi>Thrace,</hi> euen vnto <hi>Paeonia</hi> and the Ionian ſea, and ſo butteh vpon the Alpes, which is about fiue daies iournies length. His length is thriſe as great as the breadth &amp;c. And a little after, the ſame authour hath theſe words: The Romans do generally comprehend vnder that of the <hi>Illyrij,</hi> not only thoſe before cited, but alſo the <hi>Paeones</hi> beyond them, together with the <hi>Rhoeti, Norici,</hi> and <hi>Mysij</hi> which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit <hi>Europe,</hi> and whatſoeuer Nations els do border vpon theſe, which they leaue vpon the right hand that ſaile vp the riuer <hi>Iſter:</hi> and againe that they may diſtinguiſh the Hellines from the Greekes, they call them by their ſeuerall and proper names: otherwiſe generally they are by one name called <hi>Illyrij:</hi> For euen from the head of the riuer <hi>Iſter</hi> vnto the Ponticke ſea, they commonly terme them <hi>Illyrici.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Appianus. Suetonius,</hi> in the life of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth in like maner that the bounds of <hi>Illyricum</hi> are thus large at the left.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sextus Rufus,</hi> who liued in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, aſcribeth ſeuenteen prouinces to <hi>Illyricum:</hi> Two of the <hi>Norici,</hi> the two <hi>Pannonies, Valeria, Sauia, Dalmatia, Moeſia,</hi> the two <hi>Dacias, Macedonia, Theſſalia, Achaia,</hi> two <hi>Epirus, Praeualis</hi> and <hi>Creta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some do thinke that theſe countries were ſo named of <hi>Illyrius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Polyphemus:</hi> others of <hi>Illyrius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cadmus. Strabo</hi> writeth that all the ſea coaſt of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> with the ilands adioining, is furniſhed with many good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: when as contrariwiſe the whole coaſt of <hi>Italie</hi> ouer againſt this, hath none at all. It is a hot country, as <hi>Italy</hi> is, and very fertile of many ſorts of graine, famous for oliues and vines: except certaine places which are altogether rough and vntoiled. The high country which is aboue this is altogether mountainous, cold and ſnowie, eſpecially that which is toward the North. The country people in old time were much giuen to robberies and theeuing, but now they be ſomewhat more ciuill. They dwell for the moſt part in houſes of timber, thatcht with ſtraw, excepting only a few marine cities, in which their buildings are a little better. Thus farre <hi>Strabo.</hi> Amongſt the which the chiefe is <hi>Raguſi,</hi> anciently called <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> a city famous for the Mart, aſwell as for the politicke gouernment of their common-wealth. Not long ſince it was a free city, now it is tributary to the Turkes, and for that (as <hi>Nicolaus Nicolaius</hi> witneſſeth in his Obſeruations) it paieth yearely to the great Turke 12000. ducates of Gold. A deſcription of this you may read of in the tenth booke of <hi>Martin Barlet</hi> of the life of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus farre generally of <hi>Illyricum:</hi> now I thinke it not amiſſe to ſpeake ſomething of this our Mappe which doth not comprehend all <hi>Illyricum</hi> according to the iudgement of the forenamed authours, <hi>Pliny</hi> only excepted who doth reſtraine the bounds of it, as we ſaid, into a more narrow roome. There are in this Chart <hi>Hiſtria, Slauonia, Dalmatia, Boſnia, Carinthia,</hi> part of <hi>Carniola,</hi> and part of <hi>Stiria:</hi> all almoſt tributary vnto the kingdome of <hi>Hungary,</hi> except a few prouinces abuttant vpon the ſea, which belong to the Venetians. The Turke hath ſubdued the greateſt part of them to his obedience. All which countries almoſt are deſcribed in their ſeuerall Tables in this our Theater, and therefore in this place we ſpeake nothing at all of them. Only I thinke it not amiſſe to adde this one ſtory of <hi>Stiria,</hi> That this country doth breed thoſe <hi>Strumoſi,</hi> that is, a kind of people ſubiect to wennes, and that there are often ſeene ſome with ſuch huge great wennes, that they do hinder their ſpeach: and a woman giuing ſucke (as <hi>Aubanus</hi> writeth) doth caſt it ouer her ſhoulder like a ſacke or wallet, leaſt it ſhould let the child from taking the breaſt. And indeed we in the yeare 1558. iournied from <hi>Friſach</hi> by <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> where we ſaw to our great admiration, a man whoſe chin beginning at his eares was almoſt as broade as from ſhoulder to ſhoulder, and hung downe euen to his breaſt. I ſay, not without great admiration, againſt that of <hi>Inuenall, Quis tumidum guttur miretur in Alpibus?</hi> It is no wonder great, to ſee the wenne amongſt the Alpes. They commonly attribute the cauſe of the wenne to the water and aire which heere the inhabitants do vſe, and draw into their bodies. <hi>Rithmaimer</hi> this country-man borne, in his treatiſe of the ſituation of the World, hath a peculiar deſcription of <hi>Stiria.</hi> Of <hi>Boſina</hi> read <hi>D. Chytraeus</hi> his Chronicle of <hi>Saxony.</hi> Of theſe Illyrians read more at large in <hi>Dominicus Niger, Volaterran,</hi> and <hi>Lewis Verger</hi> in the Coſmography of <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Munſter,</hi> as alſo <hi>Laonicus Chalcondylas,</hi> who in his tenth booke <hi>Notiliar,</hi> hath written ſomething of this countrie worth the reading. All this tract, except thoſe ſhires which border vpon <hi>Germanie,</hi> doth ſpeake the Slauonian tongue: which, (that I may ſay ſomething of it by the way) of ſome is now called <hi>Windiſh,</hi> was thought to be that, which the Latines called <hi>Lingua Illyrica,</hi> the Illyrian tongue, and at this day is very farre ſpread, as being generally ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all the nations inhabiting between the Gulfe of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the North ſea.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Dukedome of <hi>Carinthia,</hi> (which as <hi>Rithmayer</hi> affirmeth ſhould rather be written <hi>Carnithia</hi>) hath vpon the Eaſt and North <hi>Steyrmarcke,</hi> vpon the Weſt and South the Alpes and <hi>Friuli. Carniola</hi> is part of this prouince. In this country are many valleies and hilles very good wheat grounds: many Lakes and Riuers; amongſt the which the chiefe is <hi>Drauus,</hi> or as they now call it <hi>Dra.</hi> The more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cities of this tract are, <hi>S. Veit, Villach,</hi> and <hi>Clagenfurt. S. Veit</hi> the Metropolitane city, is a city of good note, hauing a very faire large market place, wherein ſtandeth a goodly conduite of running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which we ſaw in building in the yeare 1558. The diameter or breadth of the ceſterne we tooke to be about ſeuen foote ouer. This ceſterne made of one whole ſtone of white marble, and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other monuments of antiquity digged out of the ground, was a thing worth the ſeeing. As they go out of the city toward <hi>Clagen-furt,</hi> there is a very wide champion that offereth it ſelfe, as yet beſtrewed with many ruines of ancient buildings, they commonly call it <hi>Solfeldt: Paracelſus</hi> in that his Chronicle of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (if ſo be it be his) nameth it, I cannot tell vpon what ground, <hi>Liburnia.</hi> I do rather iudge <hi>Soluenſe oppidum,</hi> the towne <hi>Solue,</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> maketh mention of in <hi>Carina,</hi> to haue long ſince ſtood heere. This is that place, where the princes are wont to be crowned abroad in the open aire, a ſtrange and vnuſuall kind of ceremony curiouſly deſcribed by <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, in his <hi>Europa. Villach,</hi> a towne, whoſe houſes in their forefront gorgeouſly painted and ſet out with hiſtories and variety of colours yeeld a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and goodly ſhew to the beholders. It is ſeated vpon the riuer <hi>Dra,</hi> in a plaine, encloſed with very high ſteepe rocks, with a great ſtone bridge ouer the riuer. <hi>Clagen-furt,</hi> a ſtrong city anciently called, as <hi>Lazius</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Claudia.</hi> Some there are that write, that the citizens of this city are ſo hardly bent againſt theeues, that vpon the leaſt occaſion of ſuſpicion of theft a man ſhall there without examination be hanged, and then the third day after that he is hanged, they ſitte vpon the triall; if ſo be that they find him to haue been vniuſtly executed, they bury him very honourably: if iuſtly, they let him hang ſtill. But <hi>Rithmayer</hi> ſaith, that this is but a meere fable. Moreouer <hi>Friſach,</hi> a very ancient towne <hi>S. Lionhart, Wolfſperg, &amp;c.</hi> are townes alſo of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In former times the <hi>Iapydes</hi> were thought to haue dwelt heere abouts. The ſoueraignty and ſecular iuriſdiction of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try doth belong vnto the Dukes of <hi>Auſtrich:</hi> but as concerning Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction it partly belongeth to the Biſhop of <hi>Salczburg,</hi> and partly to the Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> affirmeth in his forecited Chronicle. But in the ſame place he hath a moſt ridiculous etymologie of the name of this prouince, which he faineth to be fetched from the Latines, namely, that it ſhould be named <hi>Carinthia,</hi> as who would ſay, <hi>Caritas intima,</hi> Intire loue and affection. As if the firſt inhabitants who ſeated themſelues heere ſhould haue been deſirous to haue their country named by a name fetcht from a forrein nation and ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, not vnderſtood of them. The Reader not ſatisfied with this heere ſet downe by vs, let him haue recourſe vnto <hi>Sebaſtian Munſter, Sabellicus, Pio</hi> II. &amp;c. I vnderſtand alſo that one <hi>Iohn Saluian,</hi> hath ſurueied this country, whoſe deſcription as yet, I haue not ſeene.</p>

It hath many other goodly townes, amongſt the which are <hi>Cibinum, (Hermanſtadt)</hi> called of the Hungarians <hi>(Seben)</hi> ſituate vpon the riuer <hi>Cibin, Braſſouia, (Chronſtadt) Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſium, (Clauſenburg) Biſtricia, (Beſtereze)</hi> and many other built and inhabited by a people of high <hi>Germany,</hi> which we call Saxons. In this country are the <hi>Siculi,</hi> a fierce and warlike Nation: amongſt which there is neither clowne, nor gentleman, all men are in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree equall, like as amongſt the Switzers <hi>Tranſsiluania</hi> is very fertile of all maner of things, eſpecially of Gold, Siluer, and other mettalls; as alſo of Salt digged out of mountaines. It breedeth excellent Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and hath great plenty of Wine, although not ſo good as <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Slauonia.</hi> The two Walachies <hi>VValachia Tranſalpina, Walachie</hi> beyond the mountaines, and <hi>Moldauia,</hi> do encloſe <hi>Tranſsiluania:</hi> that reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon the riuer <hi>Donaw,</hi> this vpon the Euxine ſea, or <hi>Mar maiore,</hi> as the Italians call it; both of them together with <hi>Tranſsiluania</hi> do now poſſeſſe that part of <hi>Europe,</hi> which anciently was called DACIA.

            <p>But I thinke it not amiſſe to ſet downe heere the deſcription of it out of <hi>Antony Bonfinius</hi> his I. decade of the firſt booke of his hiſtory of <hi>Hungary.</hi> Beyond the Carpathian mountaines, ſaith he, is the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt prouince of <hi>Dacia,</hi> extended euen vnto the riuer <hi>Axiaces.</hi> This now vulgarly is knowen by the name of TRANSSILVANIA, they call it <hi>Sibenburghen,</hi> the Hungarians <hi>Herdel.</hi> It is a moſt fertile coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of cattell, wine, and corne: alſo of Gold and Siluer: where certaine riuers do driue downe ſhiuers of Gold, and pieces ſometime of a pound and an halfe weight; being euery way round beſet with ſteep hills in maner of a crownet. In the woods are kine or beeues with long manes like horſes; buffs and wild horſes, both very ſwift and light in running: but the horſes haue long manes hanging down to the very ground: thoſe which are tame and brought vp for ſeruice, naturally haue a very fine eaſie kind of amble. This country is inhabited partly by Scythians, partly by the Saxones and Dakes: theſe are more humane and ciuill, thoſe more rude and churliſh. In old time before the breaking in of the Gothes and Hunnes, all <hi>Dacia</hi> was poſſeſſed by the Roman and Sarmatian colonies, <hi>&amp;c. George</hi> of <hi>Reichterſdorff</hi> hath deſcribed this country in a peculiar Treatiſe.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Olonia</hi> or <hi>Poland,</hi> ſo named of the champion plaines of the ſoile, (which yet in their language they vulgarly call <hi>Pole</hi>) is a vaſt and wide country, on the Weſt bordering vpon <hi>Schleſia,</hi> on the other ſides it reſteth vpon <hi>Hungaria, Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Pruſsia.</hi> It is diuided into the Greater and the Leſſer. The <hi>Greater Poland,</hi> is that which lieth toward the Weſt, and conteineth the goodly cities <hi>Gueſna</hi> and <hi>Poſnauia.</hi> The <hi>Leſſer Poland</hi> lieth toward the South, and hath the famous city <hi>Cracow,</hi> ſeated vpon the head of the riuer <hi>Viſtula,</hi> (the Germanes call it <hi>De Wixel,</hi> the Polanders <hi>Drwencza,</hi>) which runneth through the middeſt of the country: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cities are not very great nor beautifull. Their houſes for the moſt part are all built of ſtone, and ſome are dawbed with clay. The country is very mooriſh, full of fens and woodes. The common drinke the people vſe is Beere: wine they ſeldome drinke, neither do they know how to dreſſe and manure the vine. They are counted excellent Horſemen for ſeruice in the warres. The ſoile is fertile, they haue many heards of cattell, many deere, game and paſtime for the Noblemen. It hath great plenty of Hony. Salt heere is digged out of the earth in great abundance. In the mountaines which they in their language call <hi>Tatri,</hi> they haue mines of Braſſe and Brimſtone. <hi>Cromer</hi> writeth, that the Polanders are of the Hungars called <hi>Lengel,</hi> of <hi>Leech</hi> the captaine or father of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Vnder the kingdome of <hi>Polonia</hi> are comprehended <hi>Lithuania, Samogitia, Maſouia, Volhinia, Podolia</hi> and <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> which is called <hi>South-Ruſsia,</hi> and of ſome <hi>Ruthenia:</hi> as alſo all <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> except that part which hath a peculiar Duke by whom it is gouerned. <hi>Lewenclay</hi> writeth that in the yeare 1570. the king of <hi>Poland</hi> tooke the Prince of <hi>Moldauia</hi> to his protection.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of LITHVANIA, is mooriſh and full of Bogges, for the moſt part woody, and therefore not eaſilie entered, trauelled or come vnto; it is better trading with the Lithuans in the winter then at other times: for that the moores and lakes being couered either with thicke ice or deep ſnow, the Marchants may paſſe from place to place more eaſily. In <hi>Lithuania</hi> there are few townes, and the villages are little inhabited. The chiefe wealth of the country people are cattell and rich skins of diuers ſorts of wild beaſts, wherewith the whole country is wonderfully ſtored. They haue great plenty of wax and hony. This prouince breedeth the <hi>Bugle,</hi> a kind of beaſt which they call <hi>Suber,</hi> the Germanes <hi>Vr-ochs,</hi> ſuch as was to be ſeene at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> in the yeare 1570. From hence alſo commeth that kind of beaſt which the Latines call <hi>Alces,</hi> the Dutch <hi>Elandt.</hi> The people ſpeake the Slauonian tongue, like as alſo the Polanders do. Their chiefe city is <hi>Vilna,</hi> a Biſhop ſea, and is as bigge as <hi>Cracow:</hi> but the houſes in it do not ſtand cloſe together or touch one another: but like as in the country, gardens and orchyeards are between houſe and houſe. All that Oke-timber which we call <hi>Wagenſchott,</hi> of which almoſt all the buildings carpenters worke, and ioiners worke, as well publicke as priuate, is made in the Low-countries, as alſo the greateſt part of their furniture and houſhold-ſtuffe, is feld in theſe parts, and from thence is through the Eaſt ſea, (the Latines call it <hi>Mare balticum,</hi> the Dutch <hi>Ooſtſee,</hi> the Ruſsians <hi>Wareczkouie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>) and Germane ocean, tranſported into theſe countries.</p>
            <p>In SAMOGITIA, (which in their language ſignifieth <hi>Low-land</hi>) the people are tall and of a goodly ſtature, but rude and barbarous in their maners and behauiour, vſing a ſparing and homely diet. The Ruſsians call this prouince <hi>Samotz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſemla.</hi> Heere is no maner of faire buildings, but their houſes are like houels or poore cottages; made of wood and couered with ſtraw or reed. From the bottome vpward by a little and little their buildings are made leſſe and leſſe, like the keele of a ſhip, or great helmet. In the toppe it hath one window, letting in the light from aboue, vnderneath which is the hearth or chimney where they dreſſe their meat. In that houſe they hide themſelues, their wiues, children, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, maides, ſheep, cattell, corne and houſhold-ſtuffe altogether. <hi>Sichardus</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Germany</hi> writeth that the people of <hi>Samogitia</hi> are deſcended from the Saxons: and therefore although they be ſubiect to the kingdome of <hi>Polonia,</hi> yet the Saxons challenging it to be a part of their iuriſdiction, they do affirme it to pertaine to the precinct of <hi>Saxony.</hi>

            <p>MASOVIA, is a ſhire held of the king of <hi>Poland,</hi> in homage. The chiefe or Metropolitane city of this prouince is <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouia,</hi> where they make the excellent mead, a kind of drinke made of hony &amp;c.</p>
            <p>VOLHINIA, a country abounding with all maner of things, a very fertile ſoile, full of townes and caſtles.</p>
            <p>PODOLIA, is of ſuch a fruitfull ſoile, that the graſſe in three daies will couer a ſticke being caſt into it. It is ſo ranke and groweth ſo faſt, that a plough, being left in it vpon the head-lands or graſſie places of the field, in a very few daies, wilbe ſo couered ouer that you ſhall hardly find it againe. Heere alſo is great ſtore of hony. The head city is <hi>Camyenetz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RVSSIA, yeeldeth great plenty of Horſes, Oxen, and Sheep of very fine wooll. Their drinke is mead, which they make of hony. Wine alſo is brought hither from <hi>Pannonia, Moldauia</hi> and <hi>Walachria.</hi> The chiefe city of this prouince is <hi>Leunpurg,</hi> the Latines call it <hi>Leopolis,</hi> Lion-city,</p>
            <p>MOLDAVIA is a part of <hi>Walachia,</hi> whoſe metropolitane city is <hi>Soſſouia,</hi> commonly called <hi>Sotſchen.</hi> The inhabitants of this country are a fierce and cruell people, but very good ſouldiours, and therefore they are at continuall enmity with the Tranſsiluanians. As the cuſtome of the Thracians was in old time to marke the Noblemens children with a hot iron: ſo they report that the Lords of <hi>Moldauia</hi> to this day do vſe, to marke their children, aſſoone as they be borne, with ſome kind of marke: leaſt a queſtion might ariſe whether they were the right and lawfull heires or not: and that aliens and ſtrangers might be excluded from inheritance amongſt them; as <hi>Reinerus Reineckius</hi> in his diſcourſe of noble families hath written. Many other things of thſe countries thou maieſt read of in <hi>Matthias</hi> of <hi>Michow</hi> in his diſcourſe of the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maties, <hi>Albert Crantz</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Wandalia, Bonfinius</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Laonicus Chalcondylas</hi> in his firſt and third bookes.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Romer</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Poland,</hi> deſcribeth this country on this maner: Amongſt many other nations of <hi>Sarmatia</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Boruſſi</hi> by <hi>Ptolemey</hi> are placed very farre North in that coaſt, where now, as I thinke, the Liuonians and Moſchouites do dwell, beyond the riuer <hi>Cherniſh,</hi> next neighbours to the Ryphaeans. Thoſe, with <hi>Eraſmus ſtella</hi> I iudge, to haue paſſed further South and Weſt and poſſeſſed a great part of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> which is vpon the Eaſt adioined to the Ruſsians and Moſchouites, and is encloſed on the South with woods and the Hercynian forreſt, and all that coaſt along by <hi>Pautzkerwicke</hi> or <hi>Friſh-haff,</hi> as ſome thinke, (<hi>Ptolemey</hi> calleth it <hi>Sinus Venedicus, Pliny Clylipenus</hi>) the Balticke, and Eaſt ſeas, euen vnto the riuers <hi>Viſtula, (Wixel</hi> or <hi>Weiſſel</hi>) and <hi>Oſſa;</hi> and to be called <hi>Boruſſi</hi> or <hi>Pruſſi,</hi> by names not much different. In this compaſſe now do inhabit the Liuonians, Lithuans, Samagites, and the Pruiſſen yet retaining the ancient appellation, nations diſtinct in reſpect that they are ſubiect to diuers ſtates and gouerned by different lawes and policies, but vſing altogether the ſame language vulgarly, wholly differing from the Slauonians, yet hauing diuers Latine words intermedled and mixt among, but for the moſt part corrupt, and formed rather after the Italian and Spaniſh termination, than after the Latine. Notwithſtanding the Dutch and Germanes of late yeares, conquering that part which lieth vpon the ſea, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Spruiſſe</hi> and <hi>Liuonia,</hi> haue planted their colonies there. Heere hence it is that the Dutch tongue is more familiar and vſuall to theſe people, than that ancient and vulgar language, eſpecially in the cities and townes. Which alſo is vſuall amongſt the Lithuans, who by reaſon of their neighbourhood and entercourſe with the Ruſsians, and colonies from thence enterteined, do much what ſpeake the Ruſsian language. For in that <hi>Dugloſſus</hi> deriueth the name and originall of this nation from <hi>Pruſias</hi> the king of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> it is altogether fabulous, and not worth the confuting. Some do thinke that the <hi>Boruſſi,</hi> in the German tongue were ſo called, for that they were neere the <hi>Ruſſi:</hi> but whether truly, or faſly I liſt not heere to diſpute. When and how the Latine tongue did intermedle it ſelfe with the vulgar language of the Boruſsians, Lithuanians, and Liuonians we dare not conſtantly affirme. <hi>Eraſmus Stella</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Boruſſia, (Pruſſia,</hi> or <hi>Spruſe</hi>) was rather aſſaulted by the Romanes, then conquered; and alleadgeth <hi>Pliny</hi> for his authour: whereupon that followeth that together with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the Latine tongue could not there be ſpread and planted. But <hi>Dugloſſus</hi> he telleth vs, that in thoſe ciuill warres between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> a certaine band or company of Romanes, forſaking <hi>Italie,</hi> their natiue country in thoſe troubleſome times, ſeated themſelues in theſe coaſts, and to haue built a city there, and to haue called it ROMOVE, after the name of <hi>Rome</hi> their mother: which city for a long time was the Metropolitane of that country. If this opinion of <hi>Dugloſſus</hi> be true, who may iuſtly ſuſpect, (alwaies reſerued, if there be any cauſe of doubt of the truth of the hiſtory) that that band of Romanes, lead by ſome captaine named <hi>Libo,</hi> to haue come vnto the ſea coaſt neere <hi>Friſch-haff,</hi> toward the Eaſt, and doth border vpon the Ruſsians, driuen hither either by tempeſtuous weather to haue landed in this place, or being followed by the conquerours, to haue withdrawen themſelues into theſe quarters for ſhelter againſt the raging tyranny of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſouldiers: and ſo the <hi>Libones, Liuones</hi> or <hi>Liuonians</hi> to haue receiued their name and appellation from the ſame <hi>Libo:</hi> Laſtly entending their bounds further and ſpreading themſelues euery way, ſome to haue been named <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> by a name deriued from the ſame, but much altered and corrupt, and others to haue retained ſtill the ancient appellation of the <hi>Pruſſi.</hi> Notwithſtanding alſo a great part of <hi>Pomerland,</hi> and <hi>Culmiſchland,</hi> and the skirts of <hi>Michelaw,</hi> after that they came to be ſubiect to the ſame iuriſdiction with <hi>Spruſe,</hi> and were vnder the command of the Knights of the <hi>Holy Croſſe, (Teutones Crucigeri)</hi> began to be called by one name, <hi>Spruſe:</hi> yet indeed, that is properlie and truly called <hi>Spruſe,</hi> which is comprehended between the riuers <hi>Weiſſel, (Viſtulo) Dribentz, Oſſa,</hi> and <hi>Nemen,</hi> and the bay <hi>Friſch-haff,</hi> (which we ſpoke of before) and from <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Maſſouia</hi> is diuided by thicke woods full of Meeres and Bogges. Thus farre out of <hi>Cromer.</hi> I thinke it not amiſſe alſo to ſet down heere the ancient diuiſion of this country of <hi>Spruſe</hi> into particular ſhires, as <hi>Caſper Henne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berger</hi> hath written, whoſe words are theſe.</p>
            <p>VIDIVVTO, or, as he is called of ſome, VIDINITVS, king of <hi>Boruſſia,</hi> in the yeare of Chriſt 573. when he was 116. yeares old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he together with his brother BRVTENOCRIBE, did caſt himſelfe, for a ſacrifice to his Gods, into the fire, thus diuided his poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto his ſonnes. Hee had, as they report 12. ſonnes. The I. was LITPHO, or as others call him LITALAN, to whom he gaue <hi>Lituania the Lower,</hi> &amp; made him king &amp; ſoueraigne of the reſt, but he, for the murder of CRIBE, a Biſhop of theirs ſo called, was reiected of his brethren. Amongſt the other eleuen he diuided the country of <hi>Spruſe.</hi> Of theſe the firſt called ZAMO, obtained that tract, which of him to this day is named <hi>Zambia, (Samland)</hi> hauing vpon the Weſt &amp; North the ſalt ſea; vpon the Eaſt the lake <hi>Curiſch-haff, (Curonenſis lacus)</hi> and the riuer <hi>Deme:</hi> vpon the South the riuer <hi>Pregel:</hi> it is a receiued opinion amongſt them that he dwelt in the mount GALTAGARE. II. SVDO, got for his portion that part of the country where now are <hi>Oletzo, Stradaun, Lick.</hi> part of the precincts or liberties of <hi>Iohaniſburg, Letzen, Angerburg</hi> and <hi>Inſterburg:</hi> and hath vpon the Eaſt, <hi>Lituania:</hi> on the South, <hi>Maſouia</hi> and <hi>Galindia:</hi> on the North-Weſt, <hi>Barthonia, (Barthenerland)</hi> on the North, <hi>Schalauonia.</hi> This country they called, after his name, <hi>Sudauia.</hi> Which name afterward, when this whole tract was ſpoiled and laid waſt by the <hi>Crucigeri</hi> (the knights of the <hi>Holy Croſſe,</hi>) it vtterly loſt: and therefore whether this country was called <hi>Sudauia,</hi> or not, the latter writers are wholly ignorant, and they do thinke it to haue beene in <hi>Sambia,</hi> where now is the canton called <hi>Der Sudawiſche winkel oder der Bruſter ort,</hi> but they are deceiued: For for their treachery they were of the <hi>Crucigeri</hi> tranſlated thither. III. NADROO, was ſeated between <hi>Sambia, Scalauonia,</hi> and <hi>Barthonia,</hi> where there are many riuers, forreſts, and vaſt wilderneſſes, and is called <hi>Nadraw,</hi> (NADRAVIA.) In this prouince are <hi>Tapiaw, Taplaucken, Salaw, Georgenburg &amp;c.</hi> ſtrong and defenſible caſtels. IIII. SCALAVONI, had thoſe places giuen him which are on either ſide of the riuer <hi>Memel,</hi> (the old writers called it <hi>Cronon</hi>) and therefore his portion was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Scalauonia,</hi> after his own name.

BARTHO, enioyed <hi>Barthonia, <hi>Barthenerland.</hi>
               </hi> It was diuided into the Greater, the Leſſer, and <hi>Plick Barthen;</hi> but now thoſe diuiſions are forgotten and out of vſe. VII. GALINDO, that tract from <hi>Maſouia,</hi> vnto the riuer <hi>Alla,</hi> and the lake <hi>Spirding,</hi> of him was named <hi>Galindia,</hi> and conteineth many huge deſerts: a great part of it doth belong to the Biſhop of <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and is now accounted as part of <hi>Ermeland.</hi> VIII. VARMONI, for his portion was aſsigned VARMIA, lying between the countries <hi>Galindia, Natangia,</hi> and <hi>Pogeſamia.</hi> But he not liuing long after his father, this prouince ſoone againe loſt that name, and of his mother was named by a Germane name <hi>Ermeland.</hi> IX.

CHELMO, obtained for his portion <hi>Culmigeria,</hi> or <hi>Hulmigeria</hi> (they call it <hi>Colmiſhland:</hi>) a prouince lying between the riuers <hi>Weiſſel, Mockra,</hi> or <hi>Oſſo</hi> and <hi>Dreuentza,</hi> well repleniſhed with caſtels and cities. Heere is another ſhire worth the remembrance which they call <hi>Soſſaw: Item</hi> another called LOBOVIA, <hi>(Lobaw)</hi> belonging to the Biſhop of <hi>Culm.</hi> HVNTAVV, alſo a very little prouince, but well inhabited. There is alſo an iland about <hi>Margeburg</hi> (or <hi>Marienburg</hi>) encloſed round with a bancke or wall by the <hi>Crucigeri,</hi> the knight of the <hi>Holy Croſſe,</hi> againſt the inundations and breaking-in of the riuers <hi>Weiſſel</hi> and <hi>Nogot,</hi> and it is called <hi>The Greater ile, <hi>Gros Werder.</hi> The Leſſer ile, <hi>Das klein Werder,</hi>
               </hi> is in <hi>Pomerell,</hi> about <hi>Dantzk.</hi> Laſtly, MARIANA by <hi>Marienwerder,</hi> an Iland ſo called, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, but reſerued for paſture and meddow yeelding yearely great profit.</p>

It is in all places very fertile, well watered with riuers, brookes, lakes, creekes, and in-lets from the ſea; it hath many good hauens, rich paſtures, and good corne grounds: it hath great plenty of apples, cattell, deere, fiſhes, foule, corne, butter, cheeſe, hony, wax and ſuch like commodities; it hath many rich mountaines, populous cities, townes, caſtels, and villages; there is no void place or waſt ground in it, but thoſe which lakes or mountaines do poſſeſſe. Before Chriſtianity was entertained here, they ſpake the Wandall language, and followed their faſhions and maner of life, vntill ſuch time as they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued vnder the command of the Roman Emperours, for then together with Religion they began to vſe the Saxon tongue, which to this day they retaine.

IVLINVM, a towne ſometime not inferiour vnto the goodly cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> whether you reſpect the wealth of the citizens or ſtately buildings of the ſame.

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Mappe conteineth almoſt all the Northen tract of the knowen world: but eſpecially the Neck-land or <hi>Peninſula,</hi> knowen vnto the old writers by theſe names, <hi>Scandia, Scandinauia, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> and <hi>Baſilia,</hi> but to them neuer throughly diſcried: which in regard of his greatneſſe they haue called <hi>Another World,</hi> and the Shoppe of men, and as it were the ſcabberd from whence ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations haue been drawen. But of the diuers names of this country, read that which we haue written at the mappe of <hi>Iſland,</hi> as alſo in our Treaſury of Geography, in the word BASILIA. This Neckeland in this our age conteineth three kingdomes, <hi>Norwey, Swedland</hi> and <hi>Gotland;</hi> with a part of the kingdome of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and many other prouinces, as <hi>Bothny, Finmarke, Finland Lappland, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe ſeuerall deſcriptions we will heere ſet downe out of <hi>Iames Ziegler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NORVEGIA, <hi>Norway,</hi> if you would interpret it, is as much to ſay, as the Northren tract, or Northren way. This was ſometime a moſt flouriſhing kingdome, and comprehended <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Frieſland</hi> with the circumiacent Ilands, vntill ſuch time as the kingdome was gouerned by an hereditary ſucceſſion of kings. Afterward the line failing, in the time of vacancie, by the conſent of the Nobility it was decreed, that the kings ſhould be choſen by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At this day it is vnder the iuriſdiction of the kings of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> who do not only take the lawfull reuenews iuſtly due to the crowne, but impoſing intolerable exactions, and by ſcraping and raking all commodities into their hands, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey all the wealth of this country into <hi>Denmarke.</hi> Neither is this aggreeuance alone, but with all the diſaduantage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the place doth much hurt the ſubiects: for all the hauens, roads, &amp; ſhipping are at the command of the king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke:</hi> ſo that neither they may without his leaue vſe the ſea or tranſport their merchandiſe into forren countries. This kingdome either for the temperature of the aire, goodneſſe of the ſoile, or benefit of the ſea is not of meane eſtimation and account. This doth tranſport into other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> a fiſh which is a kind of codde, ſlitte and ſpread vpon a poſt and ſo dried and hardened with the froſt and cold: and thereupon the Germanes call it <hi>Stockfiſh.</hi> The beſt time of the yeare to catch them is in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> when as the weather is coldeſt to drie them: thoſe which are taken when the weather is more mild, they ſhrinke or rotte away, and are not fit to be tranſported any whither. All the ſea coaſt of <hi>Norway</hi> is very calme and temperate: the ſea freeſeth not: the ſnow continueth not long.</p>
            <p>SVECIA, <hi>Sweden</hi> or <hi>Swedland,</hi> is a kingdome rich of ſiluer, copper, lead, iron, corne and cattell. Wonderfull plenty of fiſh is heere taken both in riuers, lakes, and creekes, aſwell as in the maine ocean. Heere are many Deere and wild beaſts. <hi>Stockholme</hi> is the kings ſeat and chiefe mart towne, a city fortified both by nature, by art, and induſtrie of the ingenious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect. It ſtandeth in a fenne, like <hi>Venice:</hi> and thereof it took the name, for that being ſituate in the waters it is built vpon piles, which they call <hi>Stockes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOTHIA, <hi>(Gotland)</hi> that is, the Good land, is ſubiect to the king of <hi>Sweden.</hi> In it is the port and mart towne <hi>Calmar,</hi> a great city. Heere is a goodly Caſtle which for ingenious Architecture or Fortification, as alſo for large compaſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is not much inferiour to that of <hi>Millane</hi> in <hi>Italie.</hi> Neere <hi>Tinguallen</hi> are mines of excellent iron. Thus farre <hi>Ziegler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of DENMARKE and the BRITISH ILES we will ſpeake nothing in this place, ſeeing that we entreated of them at their proper and ſeuerall mappes. In this chart there is deſcribed alſo ISLAND, an Iland as famous as any other for ſtrange mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and ſecret works of nature. <hi>Item</hi> GROENLAND, another Iland knowen to very few. Heere alſo is FRIESLAND, a third iland altogether vnknowen to ancient writers; neither is it once named of the latter Geographers or Hydrographers; only <hi>Nicolao Zeno,</hi> a Venetian, who, in the yeare of Chriſt 1380. toſſed with many continuall bitter ſtormes in this ſea, at laſt rent and weather-beaten, arriued in this Ile. This authour affirmeth that this iland is ſubiect to the king of <hi>Norway,</hi> and to be greater then <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that the chiefe towne is of the ſame name with the Ile it ſelfe; laſtly, that the country people do for the moſt part liue by fiſhing. For in the hauen of this towne they catch ſuch abundance of all ſorts of fiſh, that from thence they lade whole ſhippes, and tranſport them into other ilands neere adioining. The ſea next to this iland vpon the Weſt, full of ſhelues and rocks, as he writeth, is of the inhabitants called <hi>Mare Icarium, Icarus</hi> ſea: and an iland in it, he ſaith is named ICARIA. Of GROENLAND he writeth, that the winter heere is 9. moneths long, and all that time it neuer rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor the ſnow which falleth in the beginning of winter euer diſſolueth vntill the latter end of the ſame. But that is moſt wonderfull which he telleth of the Monaſtery of the order of Frier Predicants, dedicated to the honour of S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in this Iland: namely, that there is not farre from it a mountaine, which like vnto <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicilia</hi> doth at certaine ſeaſons burne and caſt out huge flakes of fire, and that there is in the ſame place a fountaine of hot or skalding waters, wherewith not only all the chambers of this monaſtery are warmed in the maner of Stones, and hot-houſes, but alſo all kind of meat and bread is ſodden and dreſſed, and with no other fire. All the monaſtery is built of a kind of hollow light ſtone, which the flames of that burning mountaine do caſt forth. For theſe burning ſtones, being by nature ſomewhat fat and oily, are ſolid and firme, but being quenched with this water, they become drie, full of holes and light; and the water wherewith they were quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched is turned into a clammy kind of ſtuffe like <hi>bitumen,</hi> wherewith theſe ſtones are laied, in ſteed of mortar, when they are to vſe them in building: and thus they make a ſure worke againſt the iniury of all weathers, Their orchyeards alſo and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens watered with this water are alwaies green and do flouriſh almoſt all the yeare long, with all maner of flowres, kinds of corne and fruits. This Priory ſtandeth vpon the ſea ſhore, and hath a reaſonable capacious and large hauen; into which the forenamed fountaine emptying his waters, doth make it ſo warme that it neuer freeſeth, in the hardeſt and egereſt froaſt that euer was knowen. Whereupon heere is ſuch abundance of fiſh, which do flocke hither from more colde places, that not only theſe Monkes, but alſo the neighbours round about are furniſhed from hence with prouiſion of victuall. Theſe thinges amongſt many others <hi>Zenus</hi> hath written of theſe Ilands, who, being made by <hi>Zichimnus,</hi> king of certaine Ilands heere about, high Admirall of his nauy, diſcouered all theſe Northren coaſts.</p>
            <p>The ile FRIESLAND, now againe in theſe our daies was deſcried by the Engliſhmen, and was by them called by a new name WEST ENGLAND. In old writers there are but few records left of theſe Ilands. Amongſt the new writers <hi>Olaus Magnus Gothus, Epiſcopus Vpſalienſis, Albertus Crantzius, Saxo Grammaticus, Iacobus Zieglerus, Sigiſmundus ab Herberſtein</hi> in his commentaries of <hi>Moſcouia,</hi> haue deſcribed theſe countries: And <hi>Nicolas Wimman</hi> hath ſet forth the nauigation of the Northren ſea. See alſo a little diſcourſe of <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Nicolas Zenis,</hi> two brethren, of the ilands ſituate vnder the North pole, together with the ſhipwracke of <hi>Peter Quirinus,</hi> written by himſelfe and <hi>Chriſtophero Fiorauante,</hi> as alſo by <hi>Nicholas Mighel,</hi> in the Italian tongue. There is alſo a diſcourſe of theſe Northren parts written by <hi>Sebaſtian Cabato,</hi> who in the yeare 1557. firſt ſailed into theſe quarters. But aboue all the hiſtory of <hi>Saxony</hi> lately written and ſet out by <hi>Dauid Chytraeus</hi> is not to be forgotten.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do find in the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory lately ſet forth and imprinted vnder the name of M. <hi>Adams:</hi> That the people of this Iland came vnto <hi>Adelbert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Breme,</hi> earneſtly entreating him to appoint them ſome learned diuines that might be able to preach the Goſpell and plant Chriſtianity amongſt them. Neither do I thinke that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mention of this Nation in any other more ancient writer than he.

For amongſt other ſhires of <hi>Norway</hi> there is one in this place which they call <hi>Tilemercke,</hi> that is, the March or ſhire of <hi>Tule.</hi> The ilands alſo ouer againſt this ſhore which vulgarly are called <hi>Hetland</hi> and <hi>Shetland,</hi> the ſeamen, as I vnderſtand out of <hi>England</hi> by the relation of my good friend M. W. <hi>Camden,</hi> are commonly called <hi>Thylinſel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I conceiue that this Iland tooke the name from the next maine land oppoſite vnto it. For what els is <hi>Thilenſel,</hi> but the iland of <hi>Thile?</hi> This opinion of mine not only <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> doth confirme, who writeth that <hi>Thule</hi> was oppoſite to the ſea coaſt of the <hi>Belgae;</hi> (he directly ſaith, I ſay <hi>Belgarum,</hi> not <hi>Britannorum littori,</hi> the ſea coaſt of <hi>Britaine</hi> where indeed <hi>Iſland</hi> is ſituate, not <hi>Thule:</hi>) but alſo <hi>Ptolemey</hi> the prince of all Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers and writers in that argument, who placeth <hi>Thule</hi> vnder the 29. degree of Longitude, and 63. of Latitude. Which poſition and calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of degrees doth exactly and preciſely fall vpon <hi>Tilemarke.</hi> And as for <hi>Iſland</hi> there is no man that hath looked with halfe an eie into Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Mappes and Charts, but doth know it to lie vnder the firſt degree of Longitude, and the ſixtieth degree of Latitude. And I perſwade my ſelfe euen <hi>Arngrimus Ionas</hi> himſelfe, an Iſlander borne, in that his Treatiſe of <hi>Iſland,</hi> where he ſaith that the latitude of this Iland is about 44. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 45. minutes was much deceiued. It is therefore as cleare as the noone day, as he ſaith, that <hi>Iſland</hi> is not the ſame that <hi>Thule</hi> was: and the ſame <hi>Procopius</hi> ſaith, that it is inhabited by thirteen Nations, and gouerned by ſo many Kings, and to be tenne times as great as <hi>Brittaine:</hi> ſo that not without good cauſe <hi>Stephanus</hi> giueth it the title of Great; when as it is certaine that <hi>Iſland</hi> is much leſſe than <hi>Brittaine.</hi> The ſame <hi>Procopius</hi> affirmeth that the <hi>Scritifinni,</hi> a kind of people ſo called, did inhabite <hi>Thule;</hi> theſe <hi>Diaconus</hi> nameth <hi>Strictofinni:</hi> and ſpeaketh of them in <hi>Scandia;</hi> as doth alſo <hi>Iornandes</hi> in his hiſtory; notwithſtanding he corruptly calleth them (that I may note this by the way) <hi>Crefennae.</hi> Thus, gentle Reader, thou ſeeſt that which they name <hi>Scandia</hi> or <hi>Scone,</hi> he calleth <hi>Thule:</hi> and the ſame nation to this day dwelleth in the ſame <hi>Scandia,</hi> called by the ſame name no whit corrupted. For they are called vulgarly <hi>Scrickefinner,</hi> and do dwell in <hi>Scandia,</hi> and not in <hi>Iſland.</hi> In <hi>Thule Procopius</hi> writeth, that there be huge great woods: in <hi>Iſland</hi> all the world knoweth there are none at all. And ſo <hi>Iſacius</hi> vpon <hi>Lycophron</hi> ſaith truly, when he affirmeth that <hi>Thule,</hi> is vpon the Eaſt of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> not vpon the North, as is <hi>Iſland.</hi> Contrary to that which <hi>Strabo</hi> (a moſt worthy and diligent Geographer, by the ſound iudgement of all the learned) ſaith of it, but from the relation, as there he addeth of <hi>Pytheas,</hi> a ſhamefull lying hiſtoriographer, whoſe cuſtome was, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his ſecond booke writeth, to counterfait and coine fables ſo cunningly that ordinarily they paſſed for true ſtories. This is that <hi>Thule,</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth, when the Romane nauy ſailed round about <hi>Brittaine</hi> was ſeen and viewed by them, but not regarded, and therefore not entered as is probable. This could not be <hi>Iſland,</hi> which is much farther off, and out of kenning. But this is enough in this place of <hi>Thule</hi> or <hi>Scandia.</hi> We will addreſſe our ſelues to ſpeake of <hi>Iſland,</hi> an iland altogether vnknowen, and not once named in any ancient writer.</p>
            <p>ISLAND, or, the <hi>Froſen</hi> or <hi>Icie land,</hi> which is all one, was ſo named of the ice which lieth continually vpon his North ſide: for there now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth the Froſen-ſea, as <hi>Crantzius</hi> writeth. It was called SNELAND, of the Snow which all the yeare long doth heere in ſome places continue: <hi>Item</hi> GARDARSHOLM, that is, <hi>Garders ile,</hi> ſo called, as <hi>Arngrimus</hi> himſelfe being an Iſlander borne writeth, of one <hi>Gardar</hi> a man ſo named who firſt found it or inhabited the ſame. This iland is an hundred Germane miles in length, as commonly moſt writers do hold; but the foreſaid <hi>Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimus Ionas</hi> ſaith it is 144. miles long. For the moſt part it is not inhabited, but is waſt and mountainous, eſpecially toward the North part: by reaſon of the bitter blaſts of the South winds, which will not ſuffer, as <hi>Olaus</hi> teacheth, ſo much as any low ſhrubbe or buſh once to put forth his head. It is ſubiect to the king of <hi>Norway,</hi> and ſo hath continued euer ſince the yeare of Chriſt 1260. at what time firſt, the ſame <hi>Arngrime</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, they did their homage to that Crowne. Whereupon the king of <hi>Denmarke</hi> euery yeare ſendeth thither a Lieutenant, by whom they are now gouerned, as in times paſt they were by certaine Biſhops of their owne; by whom they were, as we ſaid before, conuerted vnto Chriſtianity, in the time of <hi>Adelbert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Breme.</hi> In the raigne of <hi>Harald</hi> with the faire lockes, (<hi>Pulchricomus, Harfagro</hi> they vulgarly called him as <hi>Ionas</hi> writeth) who was the firſt Monarch of <hi>Norway,</hi> it was firſt begun to be inhabited, as ſome would faine perſwade: namely, when he had ouercome the pety kings and had baniſhed them out of <hi>Norway,</hi> they being driuen to ſeeke their dwelling in ſome other place, they forſooke their owne natiue country, ſhipped themſelues together with their wiues, children, and whole families, landed at the length in this iland, and heere ſeated themſelues. This ſeemeth to me to haue happened about the yeare of Chriſts incarnation 1000. but the forenamed authour <hi>Arngrimus Ionas</hi> ſaith that it was in the yeare 874. who alſo there ſetteth downe a Catalogue and names of all their Biſhops. The firſt Biſhop, as <hi>Crantzius</hi> writeth, was <hi>Iſleff.</hi> That it was ſubiect to the command of the ſame Norweies about 200. yeares, I find in the abridgement of <hi>Zenies</hi> Eclogs, where I find that <hi>Zichmi</hi> king of <hi>Frieſland</hi> attempted warre againſt this iland, but in vaine, and was repelled by a garriſon of ſouldiers placed there by the king of <hi>Norway,</hi> to defend the ſame from the aſſault of enemies. It is diuided into foure parts or prouinces according to the foure quarters of the World: namely, into <hi>Weſtfiordung, Auſtlendingafiordung, Nordlingafiordung</hi> and <hi>Sundlendingafiordung,</hi> as to ſay as the Weſt quarter, Eaſt quarter, North quarter and South quarter. It hath but two Biſhops ſeas, <hi>Schalholdt,</hi> and <hi>Hola;</hi> with certaine ſcholes adioined vnto them. In the dioceſſe of <hi>Hola</hi> are the Monaſteries <hi>Pingora, Remeſted, Modur,</hi> and <hi>Munketuere.</hi> In the dioceſſe of <hi>Schalholdt</hi> are <hi>Videy, Pyrnebar, Kirkebar</hi> and <hi>Skirda.</hi> Yet by the letters of <hi>Velleius,</hi> the authour of this chart, which he wrote vnto me, I do vnderſtand that there are heere nine monaſteries: and beſides them 329. churches. They haue no coine of their owne, nor cities: for the mountaines are to them in ſteed of cities, and fountaines for pleaſure and delights, as <hi>Crantzius</hi> teſtifieth, who affirmeth that for the moſt part they dwell in caues, making their lodgings and roomes by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and digging them out in the ſides of hilles. The which alſo <hi>Olaus</hi> doth teſtifie, eſpecially in the winter time. They build their houſes of fiſh bones, for want of wood. Contrariwiſe <hi>Ionas</hi> he ſaith, that heere are many churches and houſes built reaſonably faire and ſumptuouſly of wood, ſtone and turffe. Wares they exchange with Merchants for other wares. Forrein dainties and pleaſures they are not acquainted withall. They ſpeake the Cimbrian language, or the ancient Germane tongue, into which we ſaw this other day the holy Scriptures tranſlated, and imprinted at <hi>Hola</hi> (a place in the North part of this iland) in a moſt goodly and faire letter, in the yeare of our Lord 1584. I ſay, in the old Germane tongue: for I do obſerue it to be the ſame with that, in which a little booke that is imprinted vnder the name of <hi>Otfrides Gospels,</hi> is written in. <hi>Ionas</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth that they haue no maner of cattell beſide Horſes, and Kine. <hi>Velleius</hi> witneſſeth that they haue no trees but Berch and Iuniper. The ſoile is fatte for paſtorage and the graſſe ſo ranke, that all men that haue written of this iland do iontly and with one conſent affirme, that except they do ſometime fetch their cattell from the paſture and moderate their feeding, they wil be in danger of being ſtopped vp with their owne fatte. Yet all in vaine oft times, as the ſame <hi>Arngrime</hi> affirmeth. The ſoile is not good for corne or for eareable ground, and ſo it beareth not any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of graine, therefore for the moſt part they liue altogether on fiſh. Which alſo being dried and beaten, and as it were ground to meale they make into loaues and cakes, and do vſe it at their tables in ſtead of bread. Their drinke in former time was faire water, but now of corne, brought vnto them from forren places, they haue learned to brew a kind of beere: ſo that after they began to trade with ſtrangers reſorting to them, they began alſo to loue better liquours and haue left their drinking of water. For as <hi>Georgius Bruno</hi> maketh me beleeue, the Lubekers, Hamburgers and Bremers do yearely reſort to this iland, which thither do cary Meale, Bread, Beere, Wine, Aqua vitae, courſe Engliſh clothes and other ſuch of low prices, both Wollen and Linnen, Iron, Steele, Tinne, Copper, Siluer, Mony both Siluer and Gold, Kniues, Shoes, Coifes and Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes for women, and Wood whereof they build their houſes and make their boats. For theſe they exchange the <hi>Iſland</hi> cloth, (they commonly call it <hi>Watman</hi>) huge lumps of Brimſtone, and great ſtore of dried fiſh, <hi>Stockefiſh</hi> we call it. All this out of the Weſt and South parts of the ſame. Out of the Eaſt and North part of the iland, where there is great plenty of graſſe, they tranſport into other countries, Mutton and Beefe, butter and

Their oxen and kine are all heere polled and without hornes: their ſheepe are not ſo. <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> and <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> do tell of many wonders and ſtrange works of God in this iland, whereof ſome it will not be amiſſe to receit in this place. But eſpecially the mount <hi>Hekla,</hi> which continually burneth like vnto <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> although alwaies thoſe flames do not appeare, but at certaine times, as <hi>Arngrimus Ionas</hi> writeth, and affirmeth to be recorded in their hiſtories, as namely in the yeare 1104. 1157. 1222. 1300. 1340. 1362. 1389. and 1558. which was the laſt time that the fire brake out of this hill.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll,</hi> that is, the Holy mount. Of the which mountaine the forenamed <hi>Bruno,</hi> a laborious ſtudent, and for that his worthy worke which he hath ſet out of all the cities of the World, famous and knowen farre and neere all the World ouer, hath written in his priuate letters vnto me, that in the yeare 1580. (<hi>Ionas</hi> ſaith it fell out in the yeare 1581.) not in <hi>Hecla,</hi> but in another mount, namely, in <hi>Helgeſel,</hi> fire and ſtones were caſt out with ſuch crackes, thundering and hideous noiſe, that foureſcore miles off one would haue thought great ordenance and double canons had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged heere. At this hill there is an huge gulfe, where ſpirits of men lately departed, do offer themſelues ſo plainely to be ſeene and diſcerned of thoſe that ſometime knew them in their life time, that they are often taken for liuing men of ſuch as are not aware that they are dead: neither do they perceiue that they were deceiued, vntill the Ghoſts be gone. (<hi>Ionas</hi> accounteth this for a fable.) There are alſo certaine ſpirits or ghoſts, which do ſhew themſelues apparantly to be ſeen in the buſineſſes of mortall men, or of ſuch as came to their end by ſome violent miſchance, as <hi>Olaus</hi> reporteth. They call theſe <hi>Drols,</hi> as <hi>Rithmayer</hi> teſtifieth. (Now <hi>Drol,</hi> is a giant of the mountaines, if we may beleeue <hi>Arngrime Ionas</hi> an Ilander by birth and bringing vp.) Heere is a ſpring which by reaſon of a filthy ſmoaking water which runneth from it, killeth any thing that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the earth bringeth forth: and whatſoeuer is beſmered with this ſmokie fume, in continuance of time becommeth as hard as a ſtone, yet ſtill retaining the ſhape that it had before. There is alſo a ſpring of peſtilent waters, which whoſoeuer ſhall taſt or drinke of, will preſently be as if he had drunke poiſon. Heere alſo are certaine waters that are in propertie and taſt ſomewhat like drinke that is made of mault. There are fires heere, that will not burne or conſume flax, yet they will quite drie vp and conſume water. They haue beares, crowes, and white hares. As alſo Eagles with white tailes, as our authour <hi>Ionas</hi> the Iſlander whom we haue often cited, doth witneſſe. Theſe <hi>Pliny</hi> (as he there alleageth) calleth <hi>Pygargos,</hi> I thinke we call them <hi>Wringtailes.</hi> But thoſe that are deſirous to know all the ſtrange wonders of this iland let them read <hi>Albert Crantz, Saxo Grammaticus, Iohannes Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> whom they may beleeue or not beleeue, according as they ſhall find cauſe. To thoſe they may adioine that which <hi>Dauid Chytraeus</hi> in his Saxon hiſtory hath written of this iland.

This diuers haue ſold for the Vnicornes horne. It is thought to be a good antidote and ſoueraigne medicine againſt poiſon. This Monſter is forty elles in length. B. The <hi>Roider,</hi> a fiſh of an hundred and thirty elles in length, which hath no teeth. The fleſh of it is very good meat, wholeſome and toothſome. The fatte of it is good againſt many diſeaſes. C. The <hi>Burchualur,</hi> hath his head bigger than all the body beſide. It hath many very ſtrong teeth, whereof they make Cheſmen or Tablemen. It is threeſcore cubites long. D. The <hi>Hyena,</hi> the ſea hogge, a monſtrous kind of fiſh, of which thou maieſt read in the 21. booke of <hi>Olaus Magnus.</hi> E. <hi>Ziphius,</hi> (it may be he meaneth <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius,</hi> the ſword fiſh) an horrible ſea monſter, ſwallowing the blacke ſeale at one bitte. F. The Engliſh whale, thirty elles long: it hath no teeth, but the tongue of it is ſeuen elles in length. G. <hi>Hroſhualur,</hi> that is as much to ſay as the Sea-horſe, with a mane hanging downe from his necke like an horſe. It often doth the fiſhermen great hurt and skare. H. The greateſt kind of Whales, which ſeldome ſheweth it ſelfe; it is more like a little iland, than a fiſh. It cannot follow or chaſe the ſmaller fiſhes, by reaſon of the huge greatneſſe and waight of his body, yet he praieth vpon many, which he catcheth by a naturall wile and ſubtilty which he vſeth for to get his food. I. <hi>Skautuhvalur,</hi> this fiſh altogether full of griſtles or bones; is ſomewhat like a ray or skaite but an infinite deale bigger: when it appeareth, it is like an iland, and with his ſinnes ouerturneth ſhips and boates. K. <hi>Seenaut,</hi> ſea cowes, of colour gray: they ſometimes come out of the ſea and do feed vpon the land many in a company toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They haue a little bagge hanging at their noſe, by the helpe of which they liue in the water: that being broken, they liue altogether vpon the land, and do accompany themſelues with other kine. L. <hi>Steipereidur,</hi> a moſt gentle and tame kind of whale; which for the defence of the fiſhermen fighteth againſt other Whales. It is forbidden by Proclamation that no man may kill or hurt this ſort of Whale. It is in length an hundred cubites at the leaſt. M. <hi>Staukul,</hi> the Dutchmen call it <hi>Springual;</hi> he hath beene ſeene to ſtand a whole day together vpright vpon his taile. It is ſo called of leaping or skipping. It is a very dangerous enemy to ſeamen and fiſhers; and greedily ſeeketh after mans fleſh. N. <hi>Roſtunger,</hi> (which alſo is otherwiſe called a <hi>Roſmar,</hi>) is ſomewhat like a ſea-calfe: it goeth in the bottome of the ſea vpon foure feet, but very ſhort ones. His skinne may ſcarcely be pearced with any weapon. Hee ſleepeth twelue houres together hanging by his two long teeth vpon ſome rocke or cliffe.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Mappe comprehendeth not all <hi>Ruſsia;</hi> for heere are wanting <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> which generally are conteined vnder the name of <hi>Ruſsia:</hi> But the whole Empire of the Grand Duke of <hi>Moſcouia;</hi> which is bounded on the North by the frozen Sea; on the Eaſt, vpon the Tartars; on the South, vpon the Turkes and Polanders; on the Weſt; it abutteth vpon <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Sweden:</hi> all whoſe countries and prouinces <hi>Sigiſmundus Baro</hi> of <hi>Herber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> hath ſeuerally and particularly deſcribed; vnto whom we ſend the thirſtie Reader for further ſatisfaction. Of the Religion, habite, manners and kind of life of this Nation; we haue out of him very willingly for thine eaſe ſelected theſe few things. In their Religion they do for the moſt part follow the rites and ceremonies of the Greeke Church. Their Prieſts are maried. They haue Images in their Churches. When their children are baptized, three times dipped all ouer into the water; and the water in the font is ſeuerally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated for euery child. Although by their conſtitutions and canons they haue a kind of Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confeſsion, yet the common people thinketh it to belong only to Princes and Noblemen, and little to pertaine to them. Confeſsion being ended, and penance enioined according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the offence and fault, they ſigne them in the forehead with the ſigne of the croſſe, and with a loud mournefull voice they crie, Ieſus Chriſt, thou ſonne of God, haue mercy vpon vs. This is their common forme and maner of praier: for few can ſay the <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> They do communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the ſacrament of the ſupper both kinds, mingling the bread with the wine, or the body with the blood. They adminiſter the Lords ſupper to children of ſeuen yeares old: for then they ſay a man doth ſinne. The better ſort of men, after the communion ended, do ſpend the day in drunkenneſſe and riot; and do rather reuerence the ſame with braue apparell than inward deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the baſer ſort of people and ſeruants; for the moſt part, do labour and worke as at other times; ſaying, that to make holy day to be idle and to leaue their worke, is for gentlemen and maſters; not for poore folkes and ſeruants. <hi>Purgatory</hi> they do not beleeue, yet they make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and do other ſeruice and ceremonies for the dead. No man doth beſprinkle himſelfe or ſuffer any other to caſt holy water vpon him; except the Prieſt himſelfe will do it. In the Lent they faſt ſeuen whole weekes together. They marry; and do tolerate bigamy or permit a man to haue two wiues, but they make a queſtion whether it be a lawfull matrimony or not. They grant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorces and ſeparations. They take it not to be adultery, except one man take another mans wife. The ſtate of women in this country is moſt miſerable: for they thinke, except ſhee like a ſnaile do carry her houſe ouer her head, and be continually mewed vp in her cloſet, or ſo watched, that by no meanes ſhe may ſtart out of doores, none poſsibly can be honeſt. It is a wilie and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people, and is rather delighted to liue in ſeruitude and ſlauery, than at large and in liberty. All of them do acknowledge themſelues to be the Princes ſeruants. They are ſeldome quiet: for either they muſt make warres vpon the Lithuans, the Liuonians, or Tartars: or if they be not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in any ſeruice in forren warres, they are placed in garriſons about the riuers <hi>Don (Tanais,</hi> the ancients called it) and <hi>Occan,</hi> to repreſſe the robberies and inuaſions of the Tartars. They weare long cleit gownes, without any pleits, with ſtraite ſleeues after the Hungarian faſhion: bootes alſo, for the moſt part red and ſhort, ſuch as ſcarſe come to their knees, and ſhoes or clogges clouted and hobbed with iron nailes. They tie their girdles not about their waſts, but beneath their bellies as low as their hippes. They do ſeuere iuſtice vpon freebooters and ſuch as robbe by the high way ſide. Pilfering and manſlaughter is ſeldome puniſhed by death. Their ſiluer coines or money, are not round, but ſomewhat long, of an ouall forme or faſhioned like an egge-like figure. The country aboundeth with thoſe rich and pretious skinnes or pelts, which from hence are tranſported and caried all <hi>Europe</hi> ouer; it is almoſt euery where full of huge woods. All theſe particulars we haue drawen out of the aboue named <hi>Sigiſmund.</hi> Many things more of this country thou maiſt read of in <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Micou, Alexander Gaguine,</hi> his tract of the <hi>Sarmatiaes, Albert Crantz</hi> his <hi>VVandalia, Paulus Iouius</hi> of the Embaſſage of the Moſchouites to <hi>Clement</hi> the eight. <hi>Albertus Campenſis</hi> vpon the ſame, and in the Perſian iourneies of <hi>Ambroſio Contareno.</hi> But I would wiſh thee alſo for farther ſatisfaction heerein to read ouer the firſt and ſecond bookes of <hi>Bonfinius</hi> his firſt <hi>Decade</hi> of the hiſtory of <hi>Hungary:</hi> as alſo the firſt booke of the life of <hi>Baſilides</hi> written by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derborne,</hi> together with the Chronicle of <hi>Saxony</hi> done by <hi>Dauid Chytraeus.</hi>

            <head>TARTARIA, OR THE EMPIRE OF THE MIGHTIE CHAM.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that will take vpon him to deſcribe TARTARIA; he muſt needes ſpeake of a great number of nations, farre aſunder and remote one from another. For all that huge tract and portion of the Maine land is now called <hi>Tartaria,</hi> that is between the Eaſt ſea, (or as he calleth it <hi>Mare Mangicum,</hi> the ſea of <hi>Mangi</hi> or of <hi>Sin,</hi> a country all the World ouer, and vulgarly knowen by the name of <hi>China</hi>) and the South countries, <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> that part of <hi>India</hi> which is beyond <hi>Ganges,</hi> the country of the <hi>Saci,</hi> the riuer <hi>Iaxartes,</hi> (now they call it <hi>Cheſel</hi>) the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea, <hi>Mar delle Zabacche (Maeotis palus,</hi> it was called of the ancient writers) and Weſtward vp as high almoſt as the Moſcouites. For all theſe countries well neere the Tartars did poſſeſſe, and in theſe places they were ſeated. So that it comprehendeth that country which the old Hiſtoriographers called <hi>Sarmatia</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> both the <hi>Scythiaes</hi> and <hi>Seria,</hi> the country where the <hi>Seres</hi> dwelt, which now I take to be named <hi>Cataio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The name of this Nation was neuer heard of in <hi>Europe</hi> before the yeare after Chriſts incarnation 1212. They are diuided (in ſtead of ſhires) into <hi>Hordaes,</hi> that is, as the word amongſt them doth ſignifie, into companies or couents. But as they do inhabite large and wide countries farre diſtant and remote one from another, ſo in manners and kind of life they are as farre different. They are well limmed men, broad and fatte faced, ſcowling countenanced and hollow eied, ſhauen all but their beards, which they neuer cut low: they are ſtrong and of able bodies, and do eat horſe fleſh and other beaſts howſoeuer they come to their deaths: only hogges excepted, from which they wholly abſtaine; they can more eaſily endure hunger and thirſt than other men, a little ſleepe doth ſerue them: moreouer when they ride, if they be very hungry and thirſty, they vſe to pricke the veines of their horſes vpon which they ride, and by drinking of their bloud to ſlacke their hunger and thirſt. And becauſe they roue vp and downe and haue no certaine place of abode, they guide their courſe and iourney by the ſtars, eſpecially by the obſeruation of the North pole ſtarre, which they in their language call, as <hi>Sigiſmund Herberſtein</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Seles nicol,</hi> that is, the iron clubbe naile, or ſterne. They ſtay not long in one place, taking it to be a ſigne of ill fortune to dwell long vpon one plotte. They obſerue no maner of iuſtice or law. The people, eſpecially the poorer ſort, are very rauenous and couetous; alwaies gaping after other mens goods. They haue no maner of vſe either of gold or ſiluer.</p>
            <p>In this country thou ſeeſt TANGVT, a prouince from whence all the <hi>Rheubarbe,</hi> that is ſpent and vſed in all the world, is brought vnto vs and other places. Heere alſo is the country CATAIA, whoſe chiefe city is <hi>Cambalu,</hi> which, as <hi>Nicolaus de Comitibus</hi> writeth, is eighteen Italian miles about, or as M. <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> thirty two. It is of a ſquare forme, in ech of whoſe corners there are caſtles built, foure miles in compaſſe, where continually the Emperours garriſons are kept. But <hi>Quinzai,</hi> a city of the prouince <hi>Mangi,</hi> which is from hence Eaſtward, vpon the Eaſtern ſea, is thought to be farre big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than this: For this as the ſame M. <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> affirmeth, who dwelt there about the yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth of Chriſt 1260. is in compaſſe an hundred miles. The ſame is alſo auouched by <hi>Odericus</hi> of <hi>Friuli (de foro Iulio)</hi> who nameth it <hi>Canſay.</hi> It is ſituate in a lake of freſh water. There are in it 1260. bridges, whereof many are of ſuch great height, that ſhippes full laden may go vnder them and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſtrike ſaile Heere the Great <hi>Cham</hi> hath a ſtanding garriſon of 12000. trained ſouldiers continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſident. It is a wonderfull ſtately and pleaſant city, whereupon it obtained that name, for <hi>Quinzai,</hi> they interpret, The city of <hi>Heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tartars call their Emperour <hi>Cham,</hi> which ſignifieth the ſame that <hi>Princeps,</hi> a Prince: hereupon <hi>Cambalu</hi> is interpreted, The ſeate or city of the Prince. <hi>Sigiſmundus</hi> of <hi>Herberſtein</hi> writeth, that the Tartars do call themſelues <hi>Beſermanni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Tartars, together with their manner and courſe of life, are moſt liuely deſcribed by <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> of <hi>Herberſtein</hi> and <hi>Martine Broniouius:</hi> as alſo in the Hiſtoricall Glaſſe, or Mirour of hiſtories, writen by <hi>Vincentius Beluacenſis,</hi> in the 30. 31. and 32. bookes of the ſame. See alſo the commentaries of <hi>Hungary,</hi> written by <hi>Antonio Bonfinio:</hi> M. <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> who it is certaine liued long there amongſt them; and the Iournall or Trauells of <hi>Ioſapha Barbarus</hi> a Venetian. Of their originall, read <hi>Matthias</hi> of <hi>Michou, Haiton</hi> the Armenian, <hi>Caelius ſecundus Curio</hi> his Saracen hiſtory, and the letters of <hi>Iacobo Nauarcho</hi> a Ieſuite. Of the Tartars there be many things worth the reading in the trauells of two Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, which about the yeare 1247. were ſent into theſe quarters, by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourth, in the thirtieth chapter of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> his eigteenth booke. <hi>Laonicus</hi> alſo hath many things, in diuers places of his workes, of the Tartars vnder the name of the Scythians: the like hath <hi>Gregoras</hi> another Greeke writer. Laſtly, <hi>Dauid Chytraeus</hi> in his Saxon chronicle hath written much of this nation. But no man hath more fully and amply ſet out the maners and life of the Tartars then <hi>William Rubricius,</hi> a Friar of the order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> a copy of whoſe trauells into theſe parts, in the yeare of Chriſt 1253.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ernardinus Scalantus</hi> hath in the Spaniſh tongue ſet out a peculiar deſcription of this country in a ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tract, out of whom we haue gathered theſe few lines. This huge kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants do call TAME, and themſelues TANGIS: but of the bordering nations it is named CHINA, and is that <hi>Tein</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> which <hi>Auicenna</hi> ſo many hundred times mentioneth, and commendeth for rare ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and plants of ſoueraigne vſe in Phyſicke: and is the ſame no doubt with SINAE or <hi>Sinarum regio,</hi> a country for rich commodities much talked of amongſt all ancient Coſmographers. This country on the Eaſt bordereth vpon the Eaſt ſea: (vulgarly called <hi>Mare Cin,</hi> the ſea of <hi>China</hi>) on the South, vpon the prouince <hi>Cauchinchina:</hi> on the Weſt, it is bounded by <hi>Bramas:</hi> on the North, it hath the <hi>Tartars,</hi> a warlike and ſtout people, from whom it is defended and ſeuered partly by an artificiall wall, made by the hand and labour of man, partly by a naturall mountaine which runneth for many hundred miles together between the countries. It is a country very fertile of all maner of things neceſſary for the maintenance of mans life, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not only by the goodneſſe of the ſoile, and temperature of the aire, but eſpecially by the husbandry and induſtry of the people. For the men heere are not giuen to idleneſſe, but are very laborious and painefull. To be idle heere it is counted a ſhamefull thing. It hath wonderfull ſtore of Gold, Siluer, and Rheubarbe. The ſea which beateth vpon this coaſt, and the riuers which runne through the middeſt of this country, do abound with all ſorts of fiſh. Vpon the mountaines, vales and meddowes infinite flocks of cattell do feed and are maintained. The woods, forreſts and groues are poſſeſſed with Bores, Foxes, Hares, Conies, Zebellines, Martens, and diuers other ſuch kind of beaſts, whoſe skins are much ſet by for facings for gownes. Of all kinds of birds it yeeldeth maruallous plenty, eſpecially of water-foule, as is manifeſt by this, that in <hi>Canton,</hi> which is one of the leaſt cities of this prouince, there are ſpent euery day vpon their Tables tenne or twelue thouſand Ducks and Geeſe. They ſow the drier ground with wheat and barly: the wet, plaine or mooriſh grounds, withe riſe: which they cut or reap foure times in a yeare: this is their chiefeſt diet and liuing. The higher and ſteep places and ſides of hilles are beſet with Pine-trees: amongſt the which they ſow panicke, and pulſe or horſecorne. There is no place therefore, no field, no plot of ground vnfruitfull. Euery where are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, Gardens, Fruits, Roſes, Floures, of all ſorts yeelding a moſt fragrant and pleaſant ſmell and goodly ſhew to the beholders. They plant flax in great abundance euery where, whereof they make diuers ſorts of linnen, whereof they make their apparell: but eſpecially Sugar canes, (which heere groweth in maruellous great abundance) and the Mulbery trees for the feeding of their ſilke wormes which are maintained with the leaues of this tree. Tor <hi>Silke</hi> is the chifeſt merchandiſe and commodity, whereof they raiſe yearely an infinite gaine and profit. There are in this kingdome 240. goodly cities, the names of which do all generally end in the ſyllable <hi>fu,</hi> which in their language ſignifieth a city; as <hi>Cantonfu, Panquinfu.</hi> The townes whereof there is infinite number, they likewiſe end in <hi>Cheu.</hi> Villages which are not to be numbred, by reaſon of the continuall husbandry and tillage, are very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and wonderfully inhabited. All their cities for the moſt part, are ſituate vpon the banke of ſome great and nauigable ſtreame, fortified with broad and deep ditches, and very high ſtrong walles. Theſe wals from the foundation vpward, are made of ſtone; toward the toppe and battlement, with bricke, laid in ſteed of lime and mortar, with lome or potters clay, the ſame ſtuffe, I meane, whereof the <hi>China</hi> diſhes, ſo much eſteemed of amongſt vs, are made. The height of them and thickneſſe is ſo great, that fiue or ſix men may walke a breaſt vpon the toppe of them. Vpon the wall are placed heere and there certaine high towers and bulwarkes, out of which they may ſee all the fields ouer farre and neere round about. On ech ſide of the wals ſo much vacant ground (<hi>pomoerium</hi> the Latines call it) is leaſt, that horſemen may paſſe them ſix and ſix in a rancke in battell aray. Theſe wals are ſo cloſe and ſoundly wrought without any rifts or chinks, that one would thinke them to haue been but newly made, when as their hiſtories do teſtifie them to haue been built two thouſand yeares ſince. The entrance into the cities is by great gates moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully and ſtately built. Their ſtreets are as ſmooth and preciſely plaine, as if they were altogether made by line and leuell, and are ſo large and broad that tenne yea fifteene horſemen may ride a breaſt through them, which in many and ſundry places are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſeuered with ſtately triumphall arches, gracing the cities beyond all meaſure. Certaine Portugals do report that they ſaw in the city <hi>Fucho</hi> a turrette, ſtanding vpon forty marble pillars, whoſe height were forty hand breadth, and the thickeneſſe twelue after the meaſure which the Architects vſe. This, (they affirme in their iudgement) for greatneſſe, for exquiſite workemanſhip, beauty and coſtlineſſe, doth farre exceed all the ſtately buildings of all <hi>Europe.</hi> The greatneſſe of their cities we do gather by this, that they ſay the city <hi>Canton,</hi> which we ſaid was one of the leaſt of their cities, is twelue Engliſh miles in compaſſe; beſide 355. ſuburbes which do belong to it, very great and populous. The people are broad and round faced, thinne haired, flatte noſed, and ſmall eied: although there be ſome amongſt them reaſonable well fauoured and handſome men. The colour of their faces is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like that of thoſe which inhabite <hi>Europe,</hi> yet thoſe which dwell about <hi>Canton</hi> are of a browne complexion. They ſeldome or neuer trauell further than their owne country, neither will they eaſily ſuffer a ſtranger to dwell amongſt them, eſpecially in the vpland places, except they be publikely ſworne to be true vnto the King and Country. The wealthy and better ſort of men haue all their apparell made of ſilke of diuers and ſundry colours. The baſe and meaner ſort do weare a kind of ſtuffe made of white or blacke cotton, and ſometime linnen coloured or ſtained with party colours; for as yet in theſe parts they know not how to make wollen cloth. The men there, as women do heere, do weare their haire long, which they winde vp in a knot to the crowne of their head, where they bind and faſten it with a ſiluer bodkin. The women comb their haire very trimly, and do behang and ſet it out with gold ſpangles and diuers kind of pearles and pretious ſtones. They paint and beſmeare their faces with complexion, ſuch as the Spaniſh women do commonly vſe. They neuer once looke out of dores, except they be carried in their littars vpon mens ſhoulders, and attended by all the family.</p>

            <p>Concerning the faith and religion of this nation, it is thus: They do beleeue all earthly creatures and all things in the World, and the gouernment and diſpoſition of them, to depend of <hi>Heauen</hi> and Heauenly powers. For they do thinke that <hi>Heauen</hi> is the greateſt of all Gods; and therefore the character of it poſſeſſeth the firſt place of their alphabet. They worſhip the Sunne, the Moone and the Stars, yea the very Diuell himſelfe, (which they paint in the ſame forme, as wee do heere in <hi>Europe</hi>) that hee may do them no hurt, as they ſay. They haue ſtately and ſumptuous Churches, aſwell in the country, as in their cities. They haue alſo two ſorts of Prieſts: the one ſort go in white, with their heads ſhauen, and liue by begging, as our Friars do: the other goeth in blacke, wearing their haire long, and dwell by themſelues, as our Prieſts vſe to do heere in <hi>Europe.</hi> Neither of them may marrie, yet they liue very wantonly and licentiouſly. Thus farre out of <hi>Scalantus.</hi> It will not be amiſſe to theſe to adde ſome things out of others. <hi>Iohn Barry</hi> in his Aſian Decades giueth out, that this king hath vnder him fifteen very great and large countries; which they call Gouernments. And moreouer he addeth, that this King alone doth farre ſurpaſſe all the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> round about him: and that his yearely renenews do exceed all the riches and wealth of all <hi>Europe.</hi> For handy-craft trades and occupations they do excell all men liuing, their works are ſo finely and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly made, that one would iudge them to haue been framed by nature, and not by art and induſtrie of man. At the city <hi>Nimpo,</hi> which others call <hi>Liampo,</hi> he ſaith it hath been obſerued that ſome of the Portugals in the ſpace of three moneths, haue bought and ſhipped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way 166000. pounds of ſilke. <hi>Odoardus Barboſa</hi> writeth, that the people are very kind and humane, and go apparelled much like the Dutchmen, whom alſo they do much reſemble in pronunciation and maner of ſpeech. Thoſe cleare and tranſparent veſſels, or diſhes as white as the drift ſnow, which amongſt vs are of ſuch great eſtimation, are heere made in this maner: They mingle certaine cochle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels eg-ſhels &amp; other things together, which they knead &amp; make into a paſte. This paſte they hide in the earth, where they let it li for the ſpace of foureſcore, or an hundred yeares, before they ſtirre it or looke to it again, leauing it, as a great inheritance or pretious iewell, vnto their heires. That paſte they vſe which their grandfathers or great grandfathers haue laied vp for them. And they do obſerue duely by an ancient cuſtome, that he which taketh away the old paſte, do put new preſently in his place. <hi>Antony Pigafetta,</hi> calleth this King the moſt mighty Prince of the whole world. He ſaith that his palace, or houſe where he keepeth his Court, is encloſed with 7. wals; and that he hath alwaies 10000. ſouldiers for his gard continually there attendant vpon him: and that 70. crowned Kings do homage vnto him and are ſubiect to his gouernment and command. The ſame authour affirmeth that <hi>Muske</hi> is from hence tranſported into diuers parts of the world. <hi>Andrew Corſalis</hi> he likewiſe ſaith that the greateſt ſtore of <hi>Rheubarbe</hi> and <hi>Pearle</hi> that is brought hither to vs in <hi>Europe,</hi> doth come from hence.</p>
            <p>In the Ieſuites Epiſtles lately ſet forth in print, many things well worth the obſeruation are heere and there ſet downe of this country.

The ſecond is named <hi>Ximen,</hi> and conteineth nine kingdomes: the more famous cities of the kingdome of <hi>Bungo,</hi> are <hi>Voſuqui</hi> and <hi>Funay.</hi> The third iland is called <hi>Xicocum:</hi> it conteineth not aboue foure kingdomes or ſignio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: it is beautified with the goodly city <hi>Tonſa (Toſa</hi> he calleth it) of the ſame name with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Thus the regiments or kingdomes of <hi>Iapan</hi> are in all generally ſixty and ſix; beſide diuers other iuriſdictions which cannot iuſtly be called kingdomes. The length of the whole maine land is, as they ſay, almoſt two hundred leagues: the breadth is nothing ſo much: for in ſome places it is not aboue tenne leagues broad: at the moſt it is not aboue thirty leagues ouer.

On the Weſt lieth <hi>China, (Sinarum regno)</hi> in ſome place neerer, in ſome place further off, according to the diuers windings and bendings of the ſhore: for from the city <hi>Liampo,</hi> which is the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt bound of <hi>China,</hi> toward the Weſt, vnto <hi>Gotum, (Ogoto,</hi> I thinke) which is the firſt Iland of all <hi>Iapan</hi> that offereth it ſelfe to the view of thoſe which ſaile from thence hitherward, is not aboue threeſcore leagues but from <hi>Amacan,</hi> a mart town in the Weſt, where the Portugals for the moſt part do altogether vſe to trade, vnto the ſame <hi>Gotum,</hi> the cutte is 297. leagues ouer. On the South, neere hand it hath naught but the vaſt and wide Ocean; further off, certaine lands and countries not yet deſcried or knowne, out of which, the report goeth, that certaine ſailours came once by chance vnto <hi>Iapan,</hi> and neuer put off from thence any more to returne backe to their natiue ſoile. The country for the moſt part is full of ſnow all the yeare long, bleake and cold, and therefore not very fertile. In September they cut downe their riſe, in ſome places they reap their wheat in May: (for this generally is the vſuall food throughout the whole country) yet they make no bread of it, as we vſe heere in <hi>Europe,</hi> but a kind of pudding or pappe, which they eat in ſtead of bread. The temperature of the aire is very kind and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: their freſh waters are paſſing good: they haue alſo ſome bathes or ſprings of hot waters of ſoueraigne vertues in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, as ſome do conſtantly report. High and ſteep mountaines they haue many heere and there, but two are eſpecially fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, the one of which, whoſe name I know not, doth continually burne and caſt out flames of fire, as <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicilia</hi> was wont to do, and as <hi>Hecla</hi> in <hi>Iſland</hi> now vſually doth at certaine times. In the toppe of this mountaine, the Diuell, encloſed in a white clowd, ſheweth himſelfe to certaine men, after that for deuotions ſake they haue long faſted and pined themſelues. The other, called <hi>Figenoiama,</hi> ariſeth vp certaine leagues aboue the cloudes. The people do digge ſundry ſorts of mettals out of the bowels of the earth, whereby they intice forren Nations to come from farre vnto their quarters. Trees they haue both for pleaſure and for profit or fruit not much vnlike ours heere in <hi>Europe:</hi> yet there is one tree, which doth much reſemble the Palme-tree, whoſe nature is very ſtrange: for, as they affirme, it is afraid of any maner of moiſture: and if ſo be by chance it happen to be wette, it ſhrinketh together, and as if it had been infected with the plague, ſmitten or blaſted, it withereth and dieth immediately. The helpe and meanes to recouer it againe, is to plucke it vp by the roots and to drie it in the ſunne: then to lay it in a dry ditch or empty pit, and to couer it all ouer, either with the ruſt of iron beaten to powder, or elſe with ſand: there, after it is planted and ſet into the ground againe, it groweth and buddeth as afore, and ſo it flouriſheth and becommeth as trimme and beautifull as euer it was: the boughes alſo that fall off, or are broken off, if they be faſtened with a naile vnto the ſtocke or body of the tree, they will grow and ioine to the ſame aſwell as if they had beene grafted into it. Heere are euery where great ſtore of Cedar trees, of ſuch height and thickeneſſe, that hereof the carpenters make ſummers for houſes, pillars and columnes for ſtately buildings, and the ſhipwrights maſts for the taleſt and greateſt ſhippes of burden that in thoſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they vſually make. Sheep, hogges, hennes, ducks, geeſe, and ſuch other filthy kinds of liuing creatures they ſeldome or neuer keep at home about their houſes: if they pleaſe to eat fleſh meat, they only eat veniſon, and ſuch as they catch abroad in the wild fields. The fields are beſpread with many heards of cattell, as kine and horſes for ſeruice in the warres: in the forreſts, woods and buſhie grounds, woolues, conies, bores, ſtagges and other deere do wander vp and downe: they haue plenty of pheſants, wild ducks, ſtock-doues, quailes and wild hennes: fiſhes of diuers ſorts, but eſpecially of riuer trouts, (or ſilares as ſome call them) as alſo of ſea troutes which is not vnlike that kind of fiſh which <hi>Auſonius</hi> nameth <hi>Aloſa,</hi> and <hi>Pliny Clupea</hi> or <hi>Clypea,</hi> in the fifteenth chapter of his ninth booke: this they ſet great ſtore by and do account it for a dainty diſh. They know not what butter meaneth; oile of oliues they haue none; but they make a kind of artificiall oile of the Whales which they catch or are caſt vp vpon this ſhore: the common ſort of people do vſe moſt what boughs or ſticks of pine-trees, in ſome place ſtraw and hawme, in ſteed of candles. If any one be tall or properly made, he is not a little proud of it. Many of them liue long, and are ſtrong and luſty euen to the laſt, ſo that the moſt of them are fit for the warres till they be threeſcore yeares old. They weare their beards ſhort: but in the reſt of their haire they are very curious and haue diuers and ſundry cuttes: they ſhaue them not, but plucke them off with pulleſans or pinſers; the Boies do bare their heads from the forehead euen vp to the crowne: the baſer ſort of people and the clownes, the one halfe of the ſame: the gentlemen and noblemen, almoſt all ouer, onely leauing a few haires behind about the nape of the necke, which they hold for a great diſgrace if any man ſhall lay hand vpon, or once offer to touch. Hunger, thirſt, heat, cold, labour and ſuch like inconueniences, that do much trouble other men, they can well away withall and moſt patiently endure. As ſoone as euer they be borne and come into the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be in the midde winter, they be ſtraight caried to a riuer to be waſhed: being weaned and taken from the breaſt, they are exerciſed in hunting, and are kept apart in rough and craggy places farre from their mothers and nurces wings; for they thinke that there is nothing that doth more effeminate the minds of men, than too tender and delicate bringing vp. They beſpread and couer the floores of their houſes with fine and neat mattes, riſing and ſwelling as matrices or flockebeds. Vpon theſe, laying a ſtone or blocket vnder their heads, in ſteed of a pillow, they ſleep and take their reſt: and vpon the ſame, kneeling vpon their knees and ſitting vpon their legges, they dine and ſuppe. They are as neat and cleanly as thoſe of <hi>China:</hi> at their meat they do ſo cunningly put their meat into their mouthes with two little pricks or forkes, that they neuer droppe or let ought fall beſide, nor need once to wipe their fingers. They put off their ſhoes when they go to meat, leaſt they ſhould ſoile their carpets by treading vpon them The poorer ſort, eſpecially thoſe that dwell vpon the ſea, do liue by herbs, riſe, and fiſh: the wealthier ſort do ſet out their banquets richly and with great variety of diſhes: at euery meſſe ech mans trencher

Many times whole fowles are brought to Noblemens tables, with their bils and legs gilt all ouer. They intertaine their friends and gueſts very kindlie and bountifullie. They haue many orders and lawes of feaſting and drinking, which are performed very curiouſlie &amp; with ſtrange and exquiſite ceremonies. They haue no manner of wine, nor vines amongſt them. A kind of artificiall wine they make and preſſe out of riſe: yet they are eſpecially delighted, more than with any other kind of liquor, to drink water almoſt ſcalding hot, putting it into the powder of an hearb which they call <hi>Chia,</hi> (it is a very wholeſome hearb of ſoueraigne vertues) this kind of drinke they vſe often and are curious in the making of it; ſo that many times Princes and Noblemen, will dreſſe, prepare and mingle it with their owne hands, for an honour and grace vnto their friends: and they haue certaine places in their houſes aſſigned to this purpoſe: in which there is a furnace or fire kindled at all times readie, with a kettle of caſt iron continually hanging ouer the ſame: from hence they fetch drinke to entertaine their friends at their firſt comming to their houſe, and for their farewell at their departure: when their gueſts are to depart, they ſhew them all their treaſure and houſhold-ſtuffe which they do eſpecially eſteeme; which for the moſt part is nothing elſe but thoſe veſſels and inſtruments belonging to the making of the drinke which I ſpake of before, namely the furnace or hearth, the panne or kettle with the trefeet, the tunnell, the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cuppes or earthen pots, the ſpoones, and the boxes wherein they keep the hearb and the powder made of the ſame. Theſe things they ſet little leſſe ſtore by, than we do heere in <hi>Europe</hi> by rings beſet with pretious ſtones or bracelets of the beſt and moſt orient pearles. Their houſes for the moſt part are framed of timber, to auoid the danger of earth-quakes, which heere are very frequent and often, although that ſome haue their houſes very artificially and ſtately built from the foundation vpward of a very faire kind of ſtone. They haue many goodly Churches, and Monaſteries both of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, very rich and ſumptuous. The language of all theſe ilands is one and the ſame, but ſo diuers and manifold, and of ſuch different dialects, that it may not vniuſtly be ſaid to be many. For they haue of one and the ſame thing diuers and ſundrie names, of which ſome are vſed in ſcorne and bad ſenſe, others in good ſenſe and honourable vſage: other phraſes and words are vſed by the Nobility, others by the common people: others are ſpoken by the men, others by the women. Moreouer, they ſpeake otherwiſe than they write: and in their writing there is a great variety, for they write their priuate letters vnto their friends one way, and bookes and ſuch like another way. They haue diuers bookes, very fairely written, both in verſe and in proſe. Againe, their letters are ſuch, as in one and the ſame character they do expreſſe and ſignifie ſometime one word, ſometime two or more. Laſtly, the Iaponian language is, of indifferent iudges, preferred before the Latine, either in reſpect of the elegancy and ſmoothneſſe of pronunciation, or copy and variety of the ſame: therefore it requireth both great time and labour to learne it. They are a very warlike people and much giuen to follow that kind of life: the chiefe men of dignitie, which haue the command of the kingdome and gouernment of the ſame, they generally call <hi>Tonos;</hi> although amongſt thoſe there are alſo certaine degrees, as there are amongſt our Nobility, Princes, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, and Barons. Another ſort of men there are amongſt them, which haue the charge and managing of matters of their Church: theſe are ſhauen all ouer both head and beard: theſe may neuer marrie, but do vow perpetuall chaſtity. There are diuers and ſundrie ſects of theſe religious perſons amongſt them: ſome there are which after the maner of the Knights of the Rhodes, do iointly profeſſe armes and religion together, but they are generally called by one name, <hi>Bonzij.</hi> They haue in many places diuers great ſchooles, ſuch as we call Vniuerſities. The third ſtate or ſort of people amongſt them, are the citizens and other degrees of gentry: next vnto theſe are the retalers, huckſters, factours, and ſhop-keepers: with artificers and handiecraft-men, of diuers occupations, very ingenious and skilfull in their trades. They haue many kinds of armours and warlike weapons, made of ſundrie makings, and excellent temper. They haue alſo the vſe of Printing with letters and ſtamps, not much vnlike our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner inuented and practiſed heere in <hi>Europe.</hi> The laſt ſort and ſtate of people in theſe ilands, are the husbandmen and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Generally it is a very ſubtile, wittie and wiſe Nation, and of ſingular endowments and good parts of nature, both for acute iudgement, aptneſſe of learning, and excellency of memorie. It is no ſhame or reproach to any to be accounted poore. Slaunderous and railing ſpeeches, theeuing, robberies and that vngodlie kind of raſh othes and ſwearing, with all kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and gaming, they do vtterly abhorre and deteſt. Any offendours againſt the Law, of what degree ſoeuer, are puniſhed by no leſſe puniſhment, than baniſhment, confiſcation of goods or death. Thoſe which are to be executed are for the moſt part beheaded ſuddenlie before they are aware. Notwithſtanding it is the maner in ſome places to cary, ſuch as are taken for robberies, in a certaine kind of carre round about the city, in the face of all the people, and to hang them vp without the wals of the towne. In the ſeruice of God, which is the chiefe point of iuſtice and vertue, they do miſerably erre and ſwarue from the right tract.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat there is not a more goodly and famous country in the world, nor larger, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder one and the ſame name than INDIA, almoſt all writers iointly with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent haue affirmed. It was ſo named of the riuer <hi>Indus.</hi> The whole compaſſe of <hi>India</hi> by the iudgement of <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> is thus limited: vpon the Weſt, it hath the riuer <hi>Indus;</hi> on the North, the great mountaine <hi>Taurus;</hi> on the Eaſt, the Eaſtern ſea, wherein thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ilands, the <hi>Moluccaes,</hi> do lie; on the South, it hath the Indian ſea. In the middeſt it is diuided into two large prouinces by the goodly riuer <hi>Ganges.</hi> Of which that which is on the Weſt ſide of <hi>Ganges,</hi> is called <hi>India intra Gangem, India</hi> on this ſide <hi>Ganges:</hi> that on the Eaſt, <hi>India extra Gangem, India</hi> beyond <hi>Ganges.</hi> That in holy Scripture it is called EVILAT or <hi>Hauila:</hi> this latter ſome writers call SERIA, the country of the <hi>Seres,</hi> as <hi>Dominicus Niger</hi> teſtifieth. M. <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> ſeemeth to diuide it into three prouinces, the <hi>Greater,</hi> the <hi>Leſſer,</hi> and the <hi>Middlemoſt;</hi> which he ſaith they name <hi>Abaſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This whole country generally, not only for multitude of nations (of which, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, it is moſt populous and beſt ſtored of any country in the world) and for townes and villages almoſt infinite, but for the great abundance of all commodities (only braſſe and lead excepted, if one may giue credit to <hi>Pliny</hi>) is moſt rich and fortunate. It hath very many riuers, and thoſe very great and faire. Theſe running to and fro and in many places croſsing and watering the ſame, do cauſe it, as in a moiſt ſoile, where the ſunne is of force, to bring forth all things moſt plentifully. It ſtoreth all the world with Spices, Pearles and Pretious ſtones, as hauing greater plenty of theſe commodities than all the countries of the whole world beſides.</p>
            <p>There are neere vnto this country many goodly ilands, which heere and there lie ſcattering in the maine Ocean, ſo that it may iuſtly be tearmed the <hi>World of Ilands.</hi> But eſpecially IAPAN, which M. <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> calleth <hi>Zipangri,</hi> ſituate in this ſea, is worth the noting: which, becauſe it is not many yeares ſince that it was knowen to few or none, I thinke it not amiſſe to ſay ſomething of it in this place. It is a very large and wide iland, and hath almoſt the ſame eleuation of the Northren pole and poſition from the South with <hi>Italy.</hi> The Ilanders and people heere inhabiting, are much giuen to learning, wiſedome and religion: and are moſt earneſt and diligent ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers out of the truth in naturall cauſes. They vſe to pray and ſay ſeruice oft, which they do in their Churches in the ſame maner as the Chriſtians do. They haue but one King, vnto whom they are ſubiect and do nothing but according to his beheſts and lawes. Yet he alſo hath one aboue him, whom they call <hi>Voo,</hi> to whom the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Eccleſiaſticall matters &amp; gouernment of the ſtate of the Church is ſoly committed. This peraduenture we may not vnfitly compare to the Pope, as their King to the Emperour. To their Biſhop they commit the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and care of their ſoules. They worſhip only one God, protraitured with three heads, yet they can ſhew no reaſon of this act. They baptize their infants: by faſting, in token of penance, they labour to bring downe their bodies. They croſſe and bleſſe themſelues with the ſigne of the croſſe, againſt the aſſault of Satan: ſo that in religion, certaine ceremonies, and maner of liuing they ſeeme to imitate the Chriſtians: yet notwithſtanding the order of the Ieſuites labour by all meanes poſsibly they can, not refuſing any paines and trauell, to reduce them wholly to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Heere are alſo the MOLVCCAE, certaine ilands famous for the abundance of ſpices which they yearly yeeld and ſend into all quarters of the world. In theſe is bred the <hi>Manucodiatta,</hi> a little bird which we call the bird of Paradiſe, a ſtrange fowle no where els euer ſeen. More neere the coaſt of <hi>India,</hi> is SVMATRA, or rather <hi>Samotra,</hi> for ſo the King himſelfe of that country, writeth it, in his letters vnto his Maieſty: this Iland was knowen to the ancient Geographers and Hiſtorians by the name of TAPROBANA. There are alſo diuers other Ilands heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about of great eſtimation and fame, as <hi>Iaua Maior, Iaua Minor, Borneo, Timor &amp;c.</hi> as thou maiſt ſee in the Mappe, but we cannot in this place ſpeake of euery thing particularly and to the full. Thus farre the religion of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met is profeſſed, and from <hi>Barbary</hi> ouer againſt <hi>Spaine,</hi> euen vnto this place is the Arabicke language ſpoken or vnderſtood. The Moores from <hi>Marrocco,</hi> Ambaſſadours to our late Queene ſome fiue yeares ſince, we ſaw and heard them ſpeake that tongue naturally, in which alſo their commiſsion or letters patents were written: From <hi>Achem</hi> in <hi>Samotra,</hi> and <hi>Bantam</hi> in <hi>Iaua Maior</hi> our Merchants, this other day brought letters vnto his Highneſſe, ſo fairely and curiouſly written in that character and language, as no man will ſcarcely beleeue but he that hath ſeen them, eſpecially from ſo barbarous and rude a Nation.</p>
            <p>Of the ancient writers <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Herodotus, Pliny, Strabo, Quintus Curtius</hi> and <hi>Arrianus</hi> in the life of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> haue deſcribed the <hi>Indies.</hi> So hath <hi>Apuleius</hi> alſo in the firſt booke of his <hi>Floridorum.

            <p>Of the originall of the SOPHIES, theſe particulars following, <hi>Caelius Secundus Curio,</hi> hath tranſlated in his Saracen hiſtory, out of the Decades of <hi>Aſia,</hi> written by <hi>Iohn Barrius:</hi> In the yeare of Chriſt 1369. there was a certaine pety king amongſt the Perſians, named <hi>Sophi,</hi> who held the city <hi>Ardenelim</hi> in his poſſeſsion. This man bragged that he was deſcended lineally by his anceſtours from <hi>Muſa Cazino,</hi> nephew of <hi>Alij Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> He, the Chalife of <hi>Babylon</hi> being dead, &amp; the contrary faction maintained by the Turkes, ſuppreſſed by the Tartars, began more boldly and freely to broach his opinions of religion: and becauſe that <hi>Hocemus,</hi> the ſonne <hi>Aly,</hi> from whom he draweth his pedigree, had twelue ſonnes, minding to ſet ſome marke or badge vpon his ſect and diſciples, whereby they might be diſtinguiſhed and knowen from others, he ordained that they that would follow him, and be of his religion, ſhould weare a tire vnder the vaile, which all the Turkes do wind about their heads (they call it <hi>Tulibant</hi>) ſhould be of a purple colour, and ſhould hang out at the middeſt of the <hi>Tulibant</hi> twelue hand breadth. After his death <hi>Guines</hi> his ſonne ſucceeded in his ſteed: who did purchaſe vnto himſelfe ſuch an opinion of learning, religion and holineſſe throughout all the Eaſtern countries of the World, that <hi>Tamerlanes,</hi> that worthy and famous Emperour of the Parthians, (who ouercame <hi>Bayazet,</hi> the great Turke, and defeating all his forces, tooke him captiue) trauelling through <hi>Perſia,</hi> determined to viſite him as a moſt holy and religious Saint. To <hi>Guines, Tamerlanes</hi> freely gaue thirtie thouſand captiues, which he brought thither with him: theſe <hi>Guines</hi> afterward trained vp in his religion; whoſe ſeruice <hi>Secaidar</hi> his ſonne, eſpecially vſed in his warres: For he, after that <hi>Guines</hi> his father was dead, made warre vpon the Georgians, his neighbours bordering vpon his kingdome and countries, a kind of people of <hi>Scythia,</hi> but Chriſtians by profeſsion, and by the help of theſe Muſſulmanes, grieuouſly vexed them many kind of waies &amp;c. Let this ſatisfie thee in this place to be ſpoken of the originall of the <hi>Sophies.</hi> Theſe do make continuall warre with the Turkes about the Mahumetane religion: for becauſe the <hi>Sophies</hi> do follow one interpretour of the Alkora'n and Mahometan religion, and the Turkes another, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretours and expoſitours do much diſſent and vary one from the other, ſo that the Sophians by the Turkes are counted but as Heretiques, and contrariwiſe the Turkes are eſteemed for no leſſe by the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. It is by nature a Gentleman-like and honourable Nation, very ciuill and curteous, louing learning and liberall ſciences, and withall do much eſteeme of Nobility and Noble-men: in that are cleane contrary and oppoſite to the Turkes, which do not acknowledge or regard any difference of bloud or deſcent from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous anceſtours and great houſes.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of theſe countries, the maners, cuſtomes and behauiour of the people of the ſame, thou maiſt read of in <hi>Aloyſius Iohannes Venetus, Ioſaphat Barbarus, Ambroſius Contarenus, Iohannes Maria Angiolellus,</hi> and a certaine Merchants trauels, whoſe name I know not, together with them imprinted.

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the originall and beginning of the Turkiſh Empire, the encreaſing and grow'th of the ſame, vntill it came by little and little to that greatneſſe that now it is of, whereby it is fearefull to all nations round about, we haue gathered theſe few lines out of the beſt Hiſtoriographers of our time. In the yeare of Chriſt 1300. one OTTOMAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS a Turke, the ſonne of <hi>Zichi,</hi> a man of meane parentage, began for his pregnant witte and great experience in feats of armes and diſcipline of warre, to grow famous and renowmed amongſt the Turkes. Of this man the ſtocke of the Turkiſh Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours firſt tooke their name and beginning, and he was the firſt that ordeined a king ouer the Turkes. He raigned ſeuen and twenty yeares, in which ſpace he conquered all <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,</hi> and ſubdued many ſtrong holds neere vnto <hi>Mar Maiore,</hi> or the great ſea; ſo now the Italians call that ſea which the old writers call <hi>Mare Ponticum</hi> and <hi>Sinus Euxinus,</hi> the Greekes now <hi>Maurothalaſſa,</hi> and the Turkes <hi>Caradenis,</hi> that is, the Blacke ſea. After him ſucceeded his ſonne ORCHANES, who wonne the great and ſtrong city <hi>Pruſia</hi> or <hi>Pruſa,</hi> (now called, as <hi>Bellonius</hi> writeth <hi>Bource,</hi> and was ſometime named <hi>Zellia</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politana</hi>) which he made the head of his kingdome and place of reſidence for his Court. He was ſlaine in an vnfortunate battell which he fought againſt the Tartars, in the 22. yeare of his raigne, and left AMVRATHES his ſonne to rule the kingdome after him: who firſt, (the Grecian Princes falling at variance and calling him in) ſailed with an huge army out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe:</hi> he in a ſhort ſpace ſubdued almoſt all <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> a part of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> but himſelfe at laſt being ouercome and taken by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> died and ended his daies moſt diſhonourably. The father being taken, CALEPINVS his ſonne ſtepped into the throne, and tooke poſſeſsion of the kingdome. But hauing in battell vtterly ouerthrowen <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and his forces, and begun to waſt and ſpoile the borders and territories of the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> died in the floure of his age, when he had raigned but ſix yeares. <hi>Heere note by the way that,</hi> Adolphus Venerius <hi>doth not reckon this</hi> Calepine <hi>amongst the Turkiſh Emperours. For immediately after</hi> Baiazeth, <hi>he placeth</hi> Mahomet. <hi>And that I may giue euery man his right, the ſingular learned man, my good friend,</hi> Georgius Bruno Agrippinenſis <hi>hath taught me that the very Turkes themſelues do not account him for an Emperour.</hi> After him MAHOMETES tooke vnto him the crown of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, who made fierce warres vpon the Walachians: ſubdued a great part of <hi>Slauonia:</hi> firſt paſſed with an armie ouer the <hi>Donaw:</hi> conquered <hi>Macedonia:</hi> and pearced through the country euen as low as the Ionian ſea. He tranſlated his Court from <hi>Pruſias</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> vnto <hi>Adernopoli</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> where he died in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth yeare of his raigne. After him AMVRATH the ſecond ſucceeded in the kingdome. This man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Epirus, Aetolia, Achaia, Boeotia, Attica</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> (now <hi>Salonichi</hi>) a city belonging to the ſtate of <hi>Venice.</hi> After him MAHOMET the ſecond tooke vpon him the Diademe, he ouerthrew <hi>Athens</hi> the moſt renowmed Vniuerſity of the World. He wonne by battery the great city of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> vpon the nine and twentith day of <hi>May</hi> in the yeare after the birth of Chriſt 1452. He ſubdued the kingdome of <hi>Trapezon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> vnder his command. He tooke <hi>Corinth.</hi> He forced the ilands <hi>Lemnos (Stalamine</hi> they now call it) <hi>Euboea (Nigroponte)</hi> and <hi>Mitylene</hi> to yeeld to his obedience. He got <hi>Capha,</hi> a city belonging to the Signiory of <hi>Genua;</hi> and at <hi>Geiuiſen</hi> a city of <hi>Bithynia</hi> died in the 32. yeare of his raigne. BAIAZETH the ſecond, after his death poſſeſſed the crowne. He made warre vpon the Venetians, and wanne from them <hi>Naupactus (Lepanto,</hi> or, as the Turkes call it, <hi>Einebachti) Methona, (Modon</hi> or <hi>Mutune,</hi> a city in <hi>Peloponeſus) Dyrrachium (Durazzo)</hi> and ſpoiled all <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> He was poiſoned by a Iew his Phyſition. After whom SELYMVS his ſonne ſucceeded in the Emperiall throne. He wanne <hi>Alcairo,</hi> the ſtrongeſt city of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and killing the Souldan, ſubdued <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> and all <hi>Aegypt</hi> vnder his obedience.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt of all therefore the Knight that is to be made, prepareth himſelfe vnto his deuotions, that he may receiue the fauour of the degree of the holy order, and making his confeſsion (hauing heard Maſſe &amp; receiued the Sacrament) he is admitted into the roome where the holy ſepulchre is, and then they begin on this manner: Firſt, all being gathered together within the holy ſepulchre, they ſing this Pſalme, <hi>Come holy ſpirit &amp;c.</hi> Then this, <hi>Send forth thy ſpirit &amp;c. The Anſwear.</hi> And renew &amp;c. Lord heare &amp;c. <hi>Let vs pray,</hi> Thou Lord, which know'ſt the harts of the faithful &amp;c. Then the Gardian demandeth of him, what wouldeſt thou haue? <hi>He anſweareth vpon his knees,</hi> I do deſire to be made a knight of the order of the Holy ſepulchre of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Of what ſtate and condition of life art thou of? <hi>Anſwear.</hi> A noble man, borne of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable parents. <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Haſt thou ſufficient liuing whereby thou maiſt liue and maintaine the eſtate and dignity of knighthood, without the help of merchandiſe or vſe of any mechanicall or handie-craft occupation? <hi>Anſwear.</hi> I haue, thankes be to God, ſufficient liuing and maintenance by lands and reuenews. <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Art thou prepared to ſweare with hart and mouth, to keep and obſerue, to the vttermoſt of thy power, thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie ſacraments and orders which ſhalbe heereafter inioined thee, namely theſe which follow? Firſt, a knight of the holy order of the ſepulchre muſt euery day, if opportunity be offered, heare a maſſe or diuine ſeruice. Secondly, when need requireth, viz. when there is any generall warre againſt the Pagans or Infidels, he muſt aduenture both body and goods in the quarrell of the Church; that is, he is bound either to go in his owne perſon, or to ſend thither of his charges, ſome one ſufficient man or other. Thirdly, he is bound by that oath to defend and free, in as much as in him ſhall lie, the holy Church of God, and all the members of the ſame, from their perſecutors, and from the enemies of Chriſtianity. Fourthly, he muſt altogether ſhunne vniuſt warres, filthy lucre and hire, fencing, iuſts, torneaments, combats and ſuch like, but only for exerciſe and making of himſelfe more fit for the ſacred warre. Fifthly, he muſt procure peace and concord between faithfull Chriſtian people, do his beſt to grace and enlarge the bounds of his country, defend orphanes and widdowes, he muſt carefully take heed of curſed oathes, periuries, blaſphemies, rapes, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie, ſacriledge, murther, drunkenneſſe, ſuſpected places, infamous perſons, and to ſhunne and keep himſelfe, (as from the deadly plague) from all thoſe vices of the fleſh that mortall man by nature is ſo much ſubiect vnto: and that he do ſo cary himſelfe, that in the iudgement of men he ſhall not be blame worthy, but ſhall ſhew himſelfe worthy of that honour that he is called vnto, by frequenting the Church &amp; procuring the honour and glory of God in what he can. <hi>It is therefore demanded of him,</hi> whether he be ready with hart &amp; voice to proteſt, ſweare &amp; performe all theſe things? <hi>Anſwear.</hi> IN. do proteſt and promiſe before our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his mother, that I will, to the vttermoſt of my power, obſerue all theſe things. Theſe being done, the Sword is bleſſed or conſecrated by the Gardian, according to the bleſsing beneath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, if it be not otherwiſe conſecrated before: but if it be bleſſed, then after that bleſsing or conſecration, calling one of thoſe that are to be made Knights, and cauſing him to kneell downe before the holy ſepulchre, the Gardian putteth his hand vpon his head and ſaith: Thou N. be thou a faithfull, true, ſtout, good and braue ſouldiour of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and of his holy ſepulchre, whom we pray to vouchſafe thee his heauenly glory with his choſen Saints, <hi>Amen.</hi> Then the father Gardian giueth him a paire of gilded ſpurres, which he muſt put vpon his heeles, ſtanding vpon the ground. Afterward he giueth the naked ſword to the Knight: ſaying, Take thou N. the holy Sword, In the name of the Father and of the Sonne and of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> (making withall 3 croſſes vpon the ſame) Vſe it for thine owne defence, &amp; for the defence of the holy Church of God, to the offence and confuſion of the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt and Chriſtian faith, and to thy vttermoſt power thou ſhalt hurt no man wrongfully with it: which he vouchſafe to grant, who with the Father and the holy Ghoſt raigneth one God both now and for euer, <hi>Amen.</hi> Then the Sword is put vp into the ſcabberd, &amp; the Gardian girdeth the Sword about the Knight ſaying, Be thou N. moſt valiant, girded with thy Sword vpon thy thigh, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and obſerue, that the Saints haue conquered kingdomes not by their ſwordes, but by faith. The Knight thus girded with the Sword ariſeth, and reſting vpon his knees and leaning his head vpon the holy Sepulchre, he is dub'd by the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, 3 times ſmiting the Sword vpon the ſhoulders of the Knight, and ſaying thriſe theſe words, I ordain &amp; make thee N. a Knight of the holy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in the name of the Father and of the Sonne and of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> (making as afore 3. croſſes.) Then he kiſſeth him, and putteth vpon his necke, according to the old maner, a chaine of Gold with a croſſe hanging vpon it; Laſtly, the Knight kiſsing the Sepulcher, reſtoreth all theſe ornaments, goeth aſide, and another is called, which is to be dubbed with the like ceremonies: In the meane time the Knight firſt made muſt ſtay in the hall of the holy Sepulchre, vntill ſuch time as all the reſt that are to be preferred to this dignity, haue obtained the ſame. When they are all made, then <hi>Te Deum</hi> is ſong by the Friars, and from thence they go to the chappell of the Minorites, or elſe there they ſtay ſtill, as the Gardian ſhall pleaſe or appoint. Then theſe words following are ſpoken in the ſingular number, if there be but one: if there be many, in the plurall. In the ſingular it is ſaid, Thou more beautifull than the ſonnes of men, thou N. gird &amp;c. with thy ſword vpon thy thigh, o thou moſt mighty. If there be many it is ſpoken in the plurall number. <hi>The Verſicle.</hi> Lord heare &amp;c. <hi>Anſwear.</hi> And let my crie come vnto thee. The Lord be with you. And with thy ſpirit. <hi>Let vs pray.</hi> Grant vnto thy Church, moſt mercifull God, that being gathered together in the Holy Ghoſt, it may no manner of way be diſturbed by the aſſault of the enimy. Almighty and euerlaſting God, powre the grace of thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vpon this thy ſeruant (or theſe thy ſeruants) which at this inſtant deſireth to be girded with the glorious ſword, cauſe him, being defended by the power of thy right hand, to be continually garded with a garriſon of heauenly ſouldiers againſt all aduerſaries, whereby he may not be mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in this world with any tempeſtuous ſtormes of bitter wars, by Chriſt our Lord, &amp;c. Laſtly, the Gardian and others, if they pleaſe, do embrace him. <hi>The bleſſing of the ſword.</hi> Hee that bleſſeth it muſt hold the ſword naked before him and ſay, Our help is in the name of the Lord &amp;c. <hi>Let vs pray.</hi> Liſten, we pray thee o Lord, vnto our praiers, and vouchſafe with the right hand of thy Maieſty to bleſſe this ſword, wherewith this thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant deſireth to be armed, to the end that he may be a defendour of the Church, of widdowes, orphanes, and of all ſuch as ſerue God, againſt the fury of the Paganes and Infidels; and a terrour and dread to ſuch as ſhall aſſault or go about to hurt him, aſſuring him of the certain effect of iuſt &amp; lawfull defence and offence, by Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Amen. Let vs pray.</hi> Bleſſed Lord, holy Father almighty, and eternall God, by the inuocation of thy bleſſed name, by the comming of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, and by the gift of the holy Ghoſt, bleſſe this ſword, that this thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, which this ſame day, by thy bounteous fauour, is to be girded vnto him, may ouerthrow and beat downe all thy enemies both viſible and inuiſible, and he getting the vpper hand may continually abide void of all danger, by Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi> The bleſſed Lord, my rocke, which teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to warre: my largeſſe and my caſtle, my high tower, and my deliuerer, my protectour in whom I haue put my truſt, is he that ſubdueth my people that is vnder me. Glory be to the Father and to the Sonne &amp;c. Saue thy ſeruant o Lord God, which putteth his truſt in thee. Be thou, o Lord, vnto him a tower of ſtrength: from the face of his enemie. Lord heare our praier. The Lord be with you &amp;c. <hi>Let vs pray.</hi> O holy Lord, father almighty, who only doſt gouerne and rightly diſpoſeſt all things, who haſt by thy gratious prouidence granted to man, in this world, the vſe of the ſword to repreſſe the malice and audacious lewdneſſe of the wicked, and to maintaine right and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and wouldeſt that the order of knighthood ſhould be inſtituted for the ſafegard and protection of thy people, who alſo cauſeſt it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> to the ſoulders which came vnto him into the wilderneſſe, that they ſhould ſmite no man, but be content with their owne wages: we do humbly beſeech thy gratious goodneſſe, that as thou gaueſt to thy ſeruant <hi>Dauid</hi> power to ouercome <hi>Goliath,</hi> and madeſt <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Marcabeus</hi> to triumph ouer thoſe fierce nations which called not vpon thy name: ſo alſo to this thy ſeruant N. who lately hath ſubmitted his necke to the yoke of knighthood, grant for thy mercies ſake power &amp; ſtrength to defend faith and iuſtice, giue vnto him the encreaſe of faith, hope, and charity, and in him order all things aright that pertaine to thy feare and loue of thy holy name, to true humility, perſeuerance, obedience, and patience, that he may hurt no man wrongfully with this ſword or any other, &amp; that he may with it defend all things that are iuſt and right: and like as he now is promoted from a low and mean degree, vnto this new and honourable eſtate of knighthood, ſo he putting off the old man with all his affections, may put on the new man, that he may feare and reuerence thee aright, as he ought to do, may ſhunne the company of the wicked mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreant Infidels and may extend his charity vnto his neighbour, be truely obedient in all things to him to whom he is ſubiect, and do his duty vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly in all things that he ſhall be emploied in, by Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi> The forme of the oth which they muſt take before they may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take this holy order of knighthood vpon them, thou maiſt ſee in the Orientall iournall written by <hi>Leonard Rauwolph,</hi> in the Dutch tongue.</p>

Theſe countrie people are at this day generally of all our moderne Hiſtoriographers called ABYSSINI, or, as themſelues with the Arabians round about them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the word <hi>Hhabas,</hi> and with <hi>Al,</hi> the Arabicke article or pronoune, prefixed, <hi>Alhabas,</hi> as <hi>Beniamin</hi> reporteth; and <hi>Abexim,</hi> as <hi>Garcias ab Horto</hi> affirmeth: all which wordes indeed originally are the ſame, and do only differ either in ſound or maner of writing: for the Eaſtern <hi>Hheth,</hi> (a letter I meane proper to thoſe nations, and barbarous to vs borne in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Weſt part of the World) is diuerſlly expreſſed by diuers, (as they do well know which know ought in the Hebrew, Arabicke, Syrian, and Ethiopicke languages) ſometimes by our ſingle <hi>h,</hi> ſometime by the double <hi>hh,</hi> otherwiſe by <hi>ch,</hi> others do wholly omit it, as not finding any letter, in that language in which they write, that is of that nature and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby they may truly expreſſe the ſame. Again the laſt letter of the ſame word which the Hebrewes and Arabians call <hi>Schin,</hi> is ſometime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>ſh,</hi> ſometime by <hi>ſſ,</hi> or by the Spaniſh <hi>x,</hi> (which they ſound almoſt like our <hi>ſh</hi>) and ſometimes by <hi>s</hi> or <hi>z.</hi> For thus I find the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten often in the holy Scriptures tranſlated into Arabicke and <hi>Habaſhi</hi> and <hi>Alhabaſſi, Pſalm.</hi> 68.32. and 74.14. <hi>Item</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.13. where <hi>Ardzi' lhabas,</hi> the land of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> is the ſame that <hi>Auicenna</hi> in the 283. chapter of the ſecond tract of his ſecond booke, calleth <hi>B'ledi'lhhabaſhah,</hi> the country of the Abyſsines, or as our fathers named it, <hi>India Occidentalis,</hi> the Weſt <hi>Indies;</hi> the interpetour <hi>Gerardus Cremonenſis</hi> hath <hi>Terras al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habes, Bellunenſis</hi> hath <hi>Terras Indiae minoris,</hi> the countries of the Abyſsines, or of the leſſer <hi>India.</hi> Heere alſo it is worth the obſeruing that this word, out of all doubt, had his originall from the Hebrew שוכ <hi>Cuſh,</hi> whereby they did long ſince call this nation and people, as it is apparant out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.5. and 2.13. by the iudgement of all Interpreters, Grammarians and Iewiſh Rabbines. For the Hebrew ו, or <hi>vaw,</hi> which indeed, and in his owne nature is the ſame with our <hi>w,</hi> is pronounced of ſome nations in ſome caſes like the Germane <hi>v,</hi> or <hi>v</hi> conſonant, as they call it, ſomewhat like the ſound of <hi>b,</hi> altogether the ſame with that pronunciation of the Hebrew <hi>Beth,</hi> when it followeth a vowell, as the modern Grammarians and Iewiſh Rabbines do now teach. According to which cuſtome it is not vnlikely but that this word שוכ, which the Iewes ſounded <hi>Cuſh,</hi> ſome other nations might pronounce and vowell thus, שוח <hi>chauaſh, chabaas, habas,</hi> or <hi>Abyſſi.</hi> And indeed, the Aſians generally, and they themſelues, as <hi>Ortelius</hi> citeth out of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> do call themſelues <hi>Chuſaeos,</hi> and, as he reporteth from the relation of the reuerend <hi>B. Arias Montanus Hiſpalenſis,</hi> they are euen to this day of the Portugals ſtill called <hi>Cuſsij</hi> of <hi>Cuſh,</hi> I make no queſtion. The people are blacke, or of a deep tawny or blackiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: and blacke, we ſay in our common prouerbe, will take none other hue. Whereupon the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the 23. verſe of the 13. chapter of his prophecy ſaith thus: Can ישוכ <hi>Cuſhi,</hi> (the Abyſsine or Blacka-moore) change his skinne? or the leopard his ſpots? For the ſame reaſon alſo the learned Diuines do iudge that <hi>Dauid</hi> in the title or ſuperſcription of the ſeuenth Pſalme, by <hi>Cuſh</hi> did meane <hi>Saul,</hi> for that his deadly hate was ſuch toward him, that by no good meanes that he might vſe, he could make him change his mind, more than an Indian doth his skinne, as <hi>Kimchi</hi> the great Rabbine doth interpret this place. The people are by profeſsion Chriſtians, as appeareth by the letters of the ſaid <hi>Dauid,</hi> written vnto Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth. Of whoſe manner of life, cuſtomes and religion, we haue gathered theſe few lines, out of the trauels of <hi>Francis Aluares,</hi> written and imprinted in the Italian tongue.</p>
            <p>In theſe countries there are very many Monaſteries and Religious houſes, both of men and women: Into the Monaſteries of the men, there is neither woman, nor any liuing creature of the female ſex, that may enter or once looke within the gates. Their Monkes, which heere do hold their Lent for fifty daies together, do faſt for the moſt part only with bread and water. For in theſe countries there is ſmall ſtore of fiſh, eſpecially in the vpland places: for although the riuers are well ſtored of fiſh, yet they giue not their mind to fiſhing, becauſe they know not how to catch them; there is none skilled in that art. In time of Lent, certaine of theſe Monkes do not eat any bread at all, only they liue vpon rootes and herbs: ſome of them for all that time do neuer go to bed, nor ſleepe but as they ſit in the water vp to the chinne. In their Churches they haue bels as we haue, but for the moſt part made of ſtone. Their Miniſters and Prieſts are married. They ſay Maſſe, and do go in proceſsion with croſſes and cenſers like as they vſe in ſome Churches in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Friars do weare their haire long, but their Prieſts do not ſo: neither of them weare any ſhoes, nor any man, neither Churchman nor Layman, may once enter within the Church dores, with ſhoes on his feet. They keep Sundaies and Holy-daies, vpon which they do no manner of worke. They are all circumciſed, both men and women: but they are alſo baptiſed in the name of the Father and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt, yet not vntill the fortith day after their birth: they which liue not till this day, are buried vnchriſtened: to all thoſe that are baptized the holy communion or Euchariſt, as they call it, is at the ſame inſtant adminiſtred, powring a great deale of water into the childes mouth, that he may ſo much the more eaſily get it downe. The proper names which then are giuen them, are all of ſome ſignification. They affirme that they were conuerted vnto Chriſtian religion by <hi>Candaces,</hi> (a Queen of this country, ſpoken of in the 27. verſe of the 8. chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles) whoſe proper name they thinke was <hi>Iudith.</hi> They haue a booke diuided into 8. parts, (this they call <hi>Manda</hi> and <hi>Abetilis</hi>) which they do verily beleeue was written by all the Apoſtles being iointly for that purpoſe gathered together at <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> all the contents of this booke they do moſt diligently and ſtrictly obſerue. The baſer ſort of people do without any controwlement or feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment marry 2. or 3. wiues, according to their ability and as they can tell how to maintaine them: but theſe are excommunicated, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Cleargy to enter into the Church. Their lawes do tolerate diuorcements. The Noble-men do eſteem raw beefe, ſerued in with freſh or hot bloud, in manner as we vſe our boiled meats with pottage or ſtewed broth, for a great and dainty diſh.</p>
            <p>In all the kingdome of <hi>Preſter Iohn</hi> they haue no manner of braſen or copper money, but in ſteed of it they vſe pure gold vncoined of a certaine weight. In like manner ſalt, (yet not only in theſe prouinces, but alſo generall throughout all <hi>Africa</hi>) is vſed in exchange and buying and ſelling in ſtead of money. In ſome places ſmall pieces of iron bright and burniſhed do ſerue that turne. But pepper amongſt theſe people is of ſuch great price, that whatſoeuer a man will buy, he may eaſily obtaine it for that merchandice. Theſe countries haue almoſt all ſorts of beaſts and fowles; as Elephants, Lions, Tygres, Loſſes, (<hi>Lynces</hi> the Latines call them) Badgers, Apes and Stagges, (contrary to the opinion of the old writers, which haue generally denied that <hi>Africa</hi> doth veeld this kind of beaſt) but in all that ſix yeare which <hi>Aluares</hi> this our authour, dwelt in theſe countries, he writeth that he neuer ſaw any Beares, Conies, Linnets, Magpies, or Cuccoes. Yet <hi>Iohn Leo</hi> an African borne, in his 9. booke ſaith, that in <hi>Barbary</hi> there is wonderfull ſtore of Conies.</p>
            <p>The Locuſts do more vex and hurt this country, than any place of the World beſide, ſo that this plague is almoſt proper and peculiar to them. Such oftentimes is the number and abundance of them, that as they flie they do ſeeme to darken the aire and ſhadow the earth: they flie together in ſuch great flockes and thicke troupes that they do vtterly ſpoile and conſume the fruits ſometime of one prouince ſometime of another; wholly almoſt deuouring all their corn vpon the ground, eating vp the leaues and barkes of the trees, leauing their meddowes and paſtures bare of graſſe, ſo that the people do oftentimes leaue their natiue ſoile where they were bred and borne, and are forced, for want of victuals, to go ſeeke ſome other place to dwell in.</p>
            <p>There is in theſe quarters a city named <hi>Caſſumo,</hi> ſometime the ſeat (as their hiſtories do record) and place of the Queen of <hi>Saba, Maquedam,</hi> (that is, as I thinke, <hi>Antiſtes,</hi> a Prouoſt or Preſident) they ſay ſhe was called. By whom they affirme that <hi>Salomon</hi> King of <hi>Iſra l,</hi> had a ſonne named <hi>Meilech,</hi> (that is, <hi>The King.</hi>) In this city they are perſwaded that the Queen <hi>Cand ces</hi> did afterward dwell. But it is beſt that the Reader that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of further ſatisfaction, to haue recourſe to the ſame <hi>Francis Aluares,</hi> who hath very curiouſly deſcribed thoſe thing which he did moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerue in that his Ambaſſage into theſe countries. <hi>Item Iohn Bermundes,</hi> who ſet foorth his Ambaſſage vnto the Abyſsines, in the Portugall language. Let him alſo read a little treatiſe of <hi>Damianus à Goes,</hi> which he wrot out of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Sabellicus</hi> his 10. <hi>Enneas</hi> of his 8. booke. Of the originall of <hi>Preſter Iohn,</hi> and by what meanes he came out of <hi>Aſia</hi> (where he was knowen to writers about 200. yeares ſince) and ſeated himſelfe in <hi>Africa,</hi> read <hi>Iohn Nauarchus</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtol.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He later writers, which haue diuided <hi>Africa</hi> into foure parts, do name this <hi>Barbary</hi> for the chiefe: and they do thus bound it; On the Eaſt toward the riſing of the ſun it hath the deſerts of <hi>Marmarica</hi> (at this day they call it <hi>Barcha</hi>) euen as farre as that part of the mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> which now is vulgarly called <hi>Meies,</hi> which part peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was deſcribed by <hi>Strabo</hi> vnder the name <hi>Aspis.</hi> This mountaine (which runneth all along by the ſide of it from the Eaſt vnto the Weſt, euen to the maine ſea which of it is called <hi>Mare Atlanticum,</hi> the Atlanticke ſea) doth bound it vpon the South. On the Weſt it abutteth vpon the ſaid Atlanticke ſea. On the North coaſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterran ſea doth beat: therefore all that whole tract of <hi>Africa</hi> which formerly conteined both the <hi>Maurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Africa,</hi> properly ſo called, and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> is generally by one name called BARBARIA; all which tract, as <hi>Suidas</hi> witneſſeth, was vnder the command of King <hi>Maſmiſſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This now is held for the beſt and moſt famous part of all <hi>Africa,</hi> and is diuided into foure kingdomes, or, if you like that terme better, foure prouinces: namely, <hi>Marroccho, Feſſe, Teleſine,</hi> and <hi>Tunete.</hi> The people generally of this whole country are of a browniſh or tawny complexion. They which dwell in cities, are very ingenious in Architecture and ſuch like Mathematicall inuentions: which a man may eaſily gather by their rare and artificiall workmanſhip ſhewed in their buildings. They are (if we may beleeue <hi>Iohn Leo Africanus</hi>) moſt ſingular honeſt men: without any deceit or couen: not only making a ſhew of ſimplicity and true dealing outwardly and in word, but alſo approouing the ſame by their actions to be ſo indeed and in hart. They are very ſtout and ſtrong men; but eſpecially thoſe which dwell in the hils and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. There is no Nation vnder Heauen that is more zealous, ſo that they had rather die, than to put vp any wrong or diſgrace offered by their wiues. They are very couetous of wealth and as ambitiouſly giuen to ſeeke after honour and preferment, and therefore they trade and traffique almoſt into all quarters of the World. They which dwell in tents, that is, ſuch as follow graſing and do liue by cattell, are very kind men, courageous, patient, curtuous, good houſekeepers, and as great louers of vprightneſſe, as any men in the whole world elſewhere. But ſeeing the ſtate of the world is ſuch, that there is no man altogether bleſſed, none but haue their faults, theſe alſo are not without their vices: for the citizens, which before we ſpake of, are exceeding haughty and proud, haſty and fumiſh, ſo that the leaſt iniury or indignity that may be offered, they do, as the common ſaying is, engraue in marble, they will neuer forget it. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or vplandiſh people are ſo clowniſh and of ſuch rude behauiour, and that ſo deepely imprinted in their mindes, that they will hardly be wonne to acquaint themſelues with any ſtranger, he ſhall hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer winne their fauour. They are ſo plaine and ſimply minded, that they are eaſily drawne to beleeue things told them, although almoſt incredible. Of naturall Philoſophy they are ſo ignorant, that they hold all things done by the naturall force and operations of Nature, to be wholy ſupernaturall. They are ſo haſty and cholericke that one ſhall hardly in the day time walke the ſtreets but he ſhall ſee two or three either quarrelling or together by the eares. They neuer ſpeake but haſtily, aloud and as if they would eat one another. Thus farre of the quality and behauiour of the people, now it remaineth that we ſhould ſpeake ſomewhat of the nature of the ſoile and country.</p>
            <p>That part of the country which is toward the Mediterran ſea, is full of hils and mountaines. From theſe mountaines euen vnto famous <hi>Atlas,</hi> it is plaine and champion, yet heere and there riſing with knols and hils. Heere are very many goodly ſpringes, and therefore it is well watered with diuers pleaſant brookes and riuers. It yeeldeth great ſtore of Dates and Pomegranates: it is not very fertile for corne and graine: but of figges, and oliues with ſuch like fruites it affoordeth yearely great plenty. Mount ATLAS, verie cold and barren, on all ſides full of woods, and couered ouer with ſnow, breedeth almoſt all the riuers of <hi>Africke.</hi> Yet the cold heere is neuer ſo great and ſharp that one need to deſire to come to the fire to warme him. The later end of Autumne, all the Winter and a great part of the Spring haue many boiſterous and bitter ſtormes of wind and haile: and oftentimes they are in theſe places much vexed and affrighted with terrible thundrings and lightning: in ſome places they haue great and deep ſnowes, &amp;c. But <hi>Iohannes Leo Africanus</hi> hath deſcribed theſe countries and people very curiouſly and at large, who will ſatisfie thee at the full; to whom it thou pleaſeſt thou maieſt adioine what <hi>Ludouicus Marmolius,</hi> and <hi>Fazellus</hi> in the firſt chapter of the ſixth booke of the latter decade of his hiſtory of <hi>Sicily,</hi> haue written of this prouince. <hi>Caelius Auguſtinus Curio</hi> hath ſet out the deſcription of the kingdome of <hi>Marocho</hi> in a ſeuerall treatiſe, to him, he that pleaſeth, may adioine <hi>Diego de Turribus,</hi> who in the Spaniſh tongue hath written a booke of the Originall and Succeſsion of the <hi>Xariffes.</hi>

Of the which MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROCCHO, taketh the name of <hi>Maroccho</hi> (they call it <hi>Marox,</hi> the Spaniards <hi>Marwechos</hi>) the chiefe and metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane citie of the ſame. The territories round about this city, and generally the ſoile and fields of the whole kingdome, as <hi>Iohn Leo Africanus</hi> writeth, are moſt pleaſant and fertile, euery where beſpread with heards of cattell, flockes of ſheep and diuers ſorts of deere and wild beaſts: in all places are green and goodly paſtures, moſt plentifully yeelding whatſoeuer is neceſſary for the maintenance of mans life, whatſoeuer may recreate the ſenſes by pleaſant ſmels, or pleaſe the eies with delightſome ſhewes. The whole kingdome is almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but one large champion, not much vnlike <hi>Lombardy,</hi> the Paradiſe of <hi>Italy.</hi> The hils that are (which are but very few) are exceeding bleake, cold, and barren, ſo that they will beare nothing but barly. <hi>Maroccho</hi> which we ſaid was the chiefe city of this kingdome, is accounted one of the greateſt cities of the whole world: for it is of ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull bigneſſe, that in the raigne of <hi>Haly</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> their king, it had more than an hundred thouſand families. It hath about it 24. gates. The wall of a maruelous thickneſſe, is made of a kind of white ſtone and chalke vnburned. There are heere ſuch abundance of Churches, Colledges, ſtoues or hothouſes and innes, as iuſtly more may not be deſired. Amongſt the Churches, there is none more artificially and gorgeouſly built, than that which ſtandeth in the middeſt of the city built by the foreſaid <hi>Haly.</hi> There is another beſide this firſt, raiſed by <hi>Abdu'-lmumen,</hi> his ſucceſſour, and enlarged by <hi>Manſor,</hi> his nephew: and laſtly more richly ſet out with many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly columnes, which he cauſed to be brought out of <hi>Spaine.</hi> He made a fountaine or ceſtern vnderneath the Church, as large and wide as the whole Church it ſelfe. The roofe of the Church he couered all ouer with lead. At euery corner he made ſpoutes, by which the raine water falling vpon the roofe might runne into the ceſtern vnderneath. The ſteeple made of a very hard kind of ſtone, like that of the Amphitheater of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> is higher than that towre of <hi>Bononia</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> The greeſes or ſtaiers, by which they go vp to the toppe of it, are euery one nine handfull thicke, but in the outſide of the wall are tenne.

This hath three lofts one aboue another, into which they go vp from one to another by ſtaires or ladders made of wood. On the toppe of this ſpire vpon a ſhaft of iron, in ſteed of a weather-cocke, doth ſtand a moſt goodly Moone of pure gold, with three golden globes ſo put vpon the iron ſhaft, that the greateſt is loweſt, the leaſt higheſt of all. If any man from the toppe of the ſteeple ſhall looke downe toward the ground, the talleſt man that is ſeemeth no bigger, than a child of a yeare old. From the toppe alſo of this the cape or fore-land which they call <hi>Azaphy,</hi> being an hundred and thirty miles off, may eaſily be deſcried. And although one ſhould skarcely find a greater Church if one ſhould trauell all the world ouer, yet the place is almoſt wholly deſert: for none do euer vſe to come hither but vpon Fridaies. Vnder the cloiſters of this Church they report that there were wont to be an hundred Stationers, and as many ouer againſt them on the other ſide of the Churchyard, which daily heere kept ſhoppe, where as now I do not thinke that all this whole city can affoord at this time one booke-ſeller. Hardly the one third part of the towne is inhabited. Heere hence it is that within the wals there are many vineyeards, large gardens of palme-trees and other fruites, with goodly corne fields moſt fertile and well manured: for without the wals they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not till the ground by reaſon of the frequent inrodes of the theeuiſh Arabians. This one thing is moſt certaine, that this city is ſuddenly growne old before the time: for it is not aboue fiue hundred and ſix yeares, ſince it was firſt built. There is alſo in this city a very ſtrong caſtle, which in reſpect of the large bigneſſe, the great thickeneſſe and compaſſe of the wals, the high and many towers, or laſtly, the goodly and ſtately gates built of the richeſt Tiburtine marble, may iuſtly be accounted for a faire towne. Within this caſtle is a moſt beautifull Church with a very high ſteeple, vpon whoſe toppe is a golden moone, with three golden globes of different bigneſſes, all of them weighing 130. crownes. There haue been ſome kings of this country, who, moued with the loue and valew of the gold, haue attempted to take theſe globes downe and to put them into their purſes, but alwaies ſome ſtrange euent or misfortune or other did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their purpoſe and croſſe their deſires. So that it is now commonly amongſt the people held for a very ominous thing for any man but once to offer to touch theſe globes with his hand. Let this be ſufficient to haue ſpoken of this city in this place: he that deſireth a larger diſcourſe both of the city and caſtle, let him haue recourſe vnto <hi>Leo Africanus,</hi> who in his 2. booke will ſatisfie him to the full. In this kingdome alſo is the city TARADANT, (the Moores call it <hi>Taurent</hi>) a very great and goodly city built by the ancient Africanes. It conteineth about 3000. houſes or families. The people are more ciuill and curtuous than in other places heere about. Heere are many artificers of diuers and ſundry occupations. The towneſmen do yearely raiſe a great profit by keeping of a gard to defend merchants, that from hence do trauell vp higher into the country, from the aſſault of theeues and robbers, and to conduct and lead them the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and beſt way: for it is a place of great reſort of ſtrangers aſwell of Chriſtians as others. There are alſo other cities, as the mappe doth ſhew: amongſt the which is MESSA, hauing a Church not farre from the ſea, which they do moſt religiouſly reuerence. For there are ſome heere that moſt fondly do beleeue and affirme that the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> when he was ſent of God to preach vnto the Niniuites, was at this place caſt vp of the fiſh, which before had ſwallowed him. The ſparres of this Church and the beames are made of whale bones: for it is a common thing, for the ſea to caſt vp heere dead whales of maruailous bigneſſe. Vpon the coaſt alſo of this country is found that kind of Amber, which we call <hi>Amber-greeſe.</hi> Not farre from this city is TEINT, a towne where all thoſe rich skinnes are dreſſed, which are commonly called <hi>Maroccho</hi> pelts. More of this kingdome thou maiſt read of in <hi>Leo Africanus, Marmolius,</hi> and in the Saracen hiſtory of <hi>Caelius Auguſtinus Curio,</hi> where he hath a ſeuerall treatiſe of this prouince. Thus farre of <hi>Maroccho:</hi> it remaineth now that we ſhould ſpeake likewiſe of <hi>Feſſe.</hi>

            <p>FESSE, like as <hi>Maroccho,</hi> is a kingdome ſo called of the chiefe city and metropolitane of the ſame. This city is ſituate in the hart and middeſt of the kingdome. It was built as they affirme about the yeare of our Lord 786. Neither is it only the head city of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but it is eſteemed, <hi>The Metropolitane of all Barbary,</hi> and is vulgarly called, as <hi>Marmolius</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>The Court of all the Weſt part of the World.</hi> Some there are which do thinke it to haue been named <hi>Feſſe</hi> of a maſſe of gold, that heere was found when firſt they began to lay the foundations of the ſame: for <hi>fes</hi> in Arabicke ſignifieth an heap or maſſe. The greateſt part of the city ſtandeth vpon hils, only the middeſt of it is plaine and leuell. The riuer vpon which it is ſeated entreth it at two ſundry places, (for the one is diuided into two parts) and being entered within the wals it ſpreadeth it ſelfe almoſt into infinite branches, and is by and by, in channels, troughs, and pipes conueighed almoſt to euery priuate houſe, church, colledge, inne and hoſpitall. Laſtly, running through their vault, fewers and ſinkes, it carieth with it all the ordure and ſoile of the city out into the maine riuer, and by that meanes keepeth it continually near and cleane. The greateſt part of their houſes, built of bricke and coloured ſtones, are very beautifull and do make a goodly ſhew to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder. Moreouer the open places, galleries and porches are made of a kind of party-coloured bricke or pauement, much like vnto thoſe earthen diſhes which the Italians call <hi>Maiorica.</hi> The roofe or ſeelings of their houſes they ouerlay with gold and other moſt orient coloures very finely and gorgeouſly. The toppes of their houſes on the out ſide are couered ouer with boord a dare made plaine, ſo that in the ſummer time they may be ouerſpread with couerlets and other clothes: for heere in hot weather they vſe to lie and ſleepe all night. <hi>Item,</hi> for the moſt part euery houſe hath a turret ſeuered into many roomes and lofts, whither the women, being toiled and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may with-draw themſelues, to recreate and refreſh their mindes: for from hence they may almoſt ſee al-ouer the city. Churches and Chappels they haue in this city to the number almoſt of 700. whereof 50. are very large and goodlie, moſt ſumptuouſlie built of free

Euery Church hath one Prieſt belonging to it, whoſe charge is to ſay ſeruice there and to read praiers. The greateſt and chiefe church in this city called <hi>Carrauen,</hi> is of that greatneſſe that it is ſaid to be almoſt a mile and a halfe about. It hath one and thirty gates of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous bigneſſe and height. The ſteeple of this Church, out of which the people with a very lowd and thundering voice are called to Church, (like as we do vſe by the towling of a bell) is very high. Vnderneath this is a cellar or vault, where the oile, lights, lampes, mats and ſuch other things neceſſarily and ordinarily vſed in the Church, are kept and laid vp. In this Church there are euery night in the yeare 900. lamps lighted at once. Moreouer, in this city there are more than an hundred Bathes: <hi>Item,</hi> two hundred innes, euery one hauing ſix skore chambers apeece at the leaſt: for diuers of them haue many more. Euery inne hath a well or fountaine of water priuat to it ſelfe. In about foure hundred places you ſhall find mill-houſes, euery place hauing in it fiue or ſix mils: ſo that in all you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count heere certaine thouſands of mils. All occupations heere are allotted their ſeuerall and proper places to dwell in, euery one by it ſelfe, ſo that the beſt and more worſhipfull trades are placed neereſt the cathedrall Church. All things which are to be ſold, haue their ſeuerall market places appointed out for them. There is alſo a place aſſigned as proper to the Merchants, which one may iuſtly call a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle city, encloſed round with a bricke wall. It hath about it twelue gates, ech of which hath a great iron chaine drawne before it, to keep horſes and cartes out. And thus much of the Weſt part of <hi>Feſſe.</hi> For the other ſide which is vpon the Eaſt, although it haue many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly churches, buildings, noblemens houſes, and colledges, yet it hath not ſo many tradeſmen of ſundry occupations. Notwithſtanding heere are about fiue hundred and twenty weauers ſhops, beſides an hundred ſhops built for the whiting of thread. Heere is a goodly caſtle, equall in bigneſſe to a prettie towne, which in time paſt was the Kings houſe where he vſed to keep his court. Theſe particulars we haue heere and there gathered out of the third book of <hi>Iohn Leo</hi> his deſcription of <hi>Africa,</hi> where thou maiſt read of very many other things of this city, both pleaſant and admirable. <hi>Item Iohn Marmolius</hi> hath written ſomething of the ſame.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F Congi</hi> this kingdome of <hi>Africa</hi> (which others corruptly call <hi>Manicongo;</hi> for this word properly ſignifieth the king of <hi>Congi,</hi> and cannot he ſpoken of the country alone) my good friend <hi>Philippus Pigafetta,</hi> the authour of this Mappe, wrote a booke in the Italian tongue, this other day imprinted at <hi>Rome.</hi> Which he penned from the mouth and relation of <hi>Odoardo Lopez,</hi> a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, who had himſelfe been a long time a dweller there, and ſo a man very skilfull of the ſtate and ſituation of this country, and an ey witneſſe of that which heere is ſet downe, out of whom we haue drawen theſe few particulars: This kingdome is diuided into theſe ſix prouinces: <hi>Bamba, Sogno, Sundi, Pango, Batta</hi> and <hi>Pemba.</hi> The firſt of which is inhabited and poſſeſſed by a warlike and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry populous nation: ſo that this one by it ſelfe is able, if need be, to make <hi>40000.</hi> fighting men. The chiefe city of this prouince, and ſeat of their Kings, is <hi>Banſa,</hi> which now they call <hi>Citta de S. Saluador.</hi> All this whole prouince is very rich of ſiluer and other mettals, eſpecially about the iland <hi>Loanda,</hi> where alſo they catch abundance of thoſe ſhell fiſh which breed the pearles: theſe they do vſe in this kingdome for exchange in buying and ſelling in ſteed of money: for heere there is no manner of vſe of coine: neither do they much eſteeme of gold or ſiluer. Heere is alſo great trafficke for ſlaues, ſo that the Portugals do yearely buy and carry from hence aboue <hi>5000.</hi> Negroes. This country doth breed great ſtore of Elephants, which they in their language call <hi>Manzao.</hi> There is alſo found in theſe quarters a kind of wild beaſt, which they call <hi>Zebra,</hi> of the bigneſſe and faſhion of a mule. But that it is not a mule, it is apparent, in that this beaſt is not barren, as the mule is: for this doth breed and bring forth yong, as other beaſts do. The pelt or hide of it is different from thoſe of other liuing creatures of like ſort: for it is ſtraked with ſtrakes of three diuers colours, namely, blacke, white and yeallow or lion tawny as they call it. It is ſo wonderfull ſwift of foote and ſo wild that by no meanes it may be tamed or be made ſeruiceable for any vſe of man: whereupon they commonly vſe this for a prouerbe, <hi>As ſwift as the Zebra.</hi> There are alſo, as in other places, Lions, Tigers, Woolues, Hartes, Hares, Conies, Apes, Chamaeleons with diuers and ſundry kindes of Serpents: beſide hogges, ſheep, goats, hennes and parrattes. Crocodiles, which they terme <hi>Cariman,</hi> are heere very plentifull. But horſes, oxen and other beaſts fit for ſuch kind of ſeruices and vſes for mankind, they haue none at all. Heere doth grow great ſtore of Palme-trees. Of the leaues of this tree they make and weaue almoſt all kind of ſilke garments and apparell. For the vſe of the ſilke-wormes, which in other places is well knowen, is heere altogether vnknowen. The maner of their poſts, or maner of trauell from one place to another (for as we haue ſhewed before, they haue no horſes) I thinke it well worth the while to ſet downe in this place, out of the <hi>15.</hi> booke of <hi>Maphey</hi> his Indian hiſtories, who affirmeth that they haue no other but wooden horſes; which ſtory he thus laith downe. Vpon a rafter or beame, ſaith he, about nine inches thicke, and eight foot long, they ſpread a piece of a buffe hide of the breadth and compaſſe of a ſaddle; vpon this the traueller ſitteth ſtradling: two men beare the bayard vpon their ſhoulders, and if the iourney be long, then other two do ſhift and eaſe them of their burden. The forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med authour <hi>Pigafetta,</hi> deſcribeth another kind of carying of paſſengers from place to place, yet it is not very much different from this. Vpon the North part of this kingdome do abutte the <hi>Anzicanes,</hi> a mankind nation, a people I meane that eateth mans fleſh: ſo that heere mans fleſh is openly ſold in their ſhambles and fleſh markets, as beefe and mutton and other meat is amongst vs. That alſo which they report of <hi>Loanda,</hi> an iland vpon the coaſt of this country, I thinke it worth the noting in this place; namely, that they ſay it lieth ſo exceeding flatte and low, that it is ſcarcely ſeene aboue the water, and that it is a made ground compounded of the mudde and ſand, which the riuer againſt which it lieth, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth out into the ſea. Laſtly, that if any man ſhall digge but two or three handfuls deepe within the ground, he ſhall find freſh water, very wholeſome and good to drinke: and that which is moſt wonderfull, this ſame water when the ſea ebbeth will he ſalt, but at full ſea only it is freſh. How this nation was by the meanes of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the yeare of Grace <hi>1491.</hi> conuerted vnto Chriſt anity, and with what ſucceſſe they haue continued and gone forward, and yet ſtill conſtantly do perſiſt in the ſame, any man that liſt, may read of in the forenamed authours; <hi>Pigafetta</hi> in his ſecond booke: <hi>Maphey,</hi> in his firſt booke of the hiſtory of <hi>India:</hi> and <hi>Iohn Barros</hi> in the third chapter of the third booke of his firſt decade of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Before the entrance of the Portugals into this country, the people had no proper names; but were called by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon names, ſuch as alſo ſtones, trees, herbs, birdes, and other creatures amongst them were called by.</p>

            <head>THE GEOGRAPHY OF HOLY WRITERS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which we haue promiſed, behold now, ye ſtudents of Diuinity and Holy writte, at length we offer to your view, namely, a Map of Sacred Geography, or of ſuch places as are named by holy writers in the bookes of the Old and New Teſtaments, whether ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as the matter requireth and thou doeſt looke for, I know not: but that it is done with my beſt ability &amp; skill (to which in any matter, and therefore in this eſpecially, I dare not much rely.) I know and can truly proteſt. Yet notwithſtanding, that I haue not bereaued the learned of their due commendation in doing the like; I do acknowledge and do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linly confeſſe, we haue done what we could, ſeeing that we might not performe what we would. Therefore what heere we offer it is rather our will, than our wiſh. Two things, moſt kind Reader, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thee to obſerue and marke, before thou iudge and cenſure this our labour. Firſt, that in the Geographicall names of places, we haue followed the tranſlation of Septuagints: becauſe that is but one and vniforme. The Latine tranſlations as they are many, ſo alſo they are different, and in naming of places they vary much and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent one from another: ſo that that word which one doth interpret properly, another otherwiſe doth tranſlate it according to the ſenſe and meaning. Which is, that I may vſe <hi>Varroes</hi> phraſe, to make a noune appellatiue of a proper name: and contrariwiſe of proper names to make appellatiues. Examples of which thou maiſt ſee in the annotations of <hi>Emauel Sà,</hi> as alſo in our Geographicall Treaſure. Therefore where we ſticke as doubtfull, which of theſe different readings and writings of proper names we may take, we runne vnto the 72. interpretours as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſure ground. It any man be deſirous to know how otherwiſe the Latine interpretors do call theſe proper names, let him haue recourſe to our Treaſurie, and he ſhall without any great difficulty eaſily ſatisfie his deſire. For in this he ſhall find all the Synonymes of places digeſted according to the order of the Alphabet. The other thing, gentle Reader, which I would haue thee to obſerue, and neceſſarily ought to be done, leaſt preiudice do go before ſound iudgement; is this, the ſeats of all places of <hi>Paleſtina</hi> are not ſet downe in this our Mapp, but a few of thoſe that are more famous, according to the capacity of the table: (for thou ſeeſt how ſtraite and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it is:) what heere is wanting may be ſupplied out of the Tables following; two of <hi>Tileman Stella;</hi> the third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled the <hi>Peregrination of S. Paul,</hi> and the fourth intituled the <hi>Peregrination of the Patriarch Abraham.</hi> For if all theſe ſhould haue been portraitured and ioined together in one and the ſame Mappe, it would grow too much too great: yea it would be ſo great and huge that it would exceed this, which heere we giue; an hundred times; and ſo by reaſon of the greatneſſe, it would not only be troubleſome in vſe, but alſo vnpleaſant to the eie. In the hart and middeſt of the plotte; where thou ſeeſt <hi>Syria,</hi> as it hath been ſufficiently repleniſhed and filled with places, ſo in places round about vpon the coaſts on all ſides, it is moſt empty and barren: ſo that it would appeare like a ſmall iland in the vaſt ocean, and would ſoone haue growen into a great, burdenſome and chargeable bigneſſe to no purpoſe or profit at all.</p>
            <p>We haue vpon the ſide in a void place ſet the Mappe of the whole World, whereby the diligent ſtudent of Diuinity by conferring might eaſily ſee, what and how great a portion of the ſame, the holy hiſtory doth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comprehend: and at once; iointly with the ſame labour to find out the ſituation and poſition of two famous places mentioned in the holy Scriptures: namely of the ſituation of the country <hi>Ophyr</hi> and the earthly <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Of the which although many men do write many and diuers things, and the opinions of the learned be different, yet we haue alſo ſet downe our iudgement, willingly giuing leaue to the learned Reader, in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion, to take which him pleaſeth: and he may read, if he thinke good, that which in our Geographicall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie, we haue written more at large of <hi>Ophyr.</hi> Of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> alſo there is the like controuerſie and queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Diuines. The moſt men do place it in the Eaſt, others in <hi>Syria; Poſtellus,</hi> vnder the pole Arcticke. Some there are which do geſſe it to haue been vnder the Equinoctiall line. <hi>Goropius,</hi> our countrieman, is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by many arguments that it was in <hi>Indoſcythia,</hi> a prouince of <hi>India</hi> in the Eaſt, abutting vpon the riuer <hi>Indus.</hi> Some of the old writers did imagine it to reach as high as the ſphere of the moone: others do place it in other places. <hi>Caeſarius</hi> the brother of <hi>Nazianzene</hi> in his Dialogues, in what place he ſuppoſeth it to be, I cannot deuiſe: for he maketh <hi>Donaw</hi> one of thoſe foure riuers; namely, that which ſacred antiquity called <hi>Phiſon:</hi> this Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> do vnderſtand to haue been <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> others <hi>Ganges</hi> in Eaſt <hi>India:</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> againſt the Manicheies hath this opinion: <hi>Beatam vitam, Paradiſi nomine ſignificatam exiſtimo:</hi> By <hi>Paradiſe</hi> I do thinke the bleſſed life to be vnderſtood.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ANAAN,</hi> The moſt ancient name of this country was <hi>Canaan,</hi> which it tooke of <hi>Chanaan</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cham,</hi> whoſe poſterity diuided it amongst themſelues and first inhabited it. Their names were theſe, <hi>Sidon, Heth, Iebuſy, Emory, Gergeſy, Heuy, Arky, Siny, Aruady, Semary,</hi> and <hi>Hamathy,</hi> Gen. <hi>10.15.16.17.18.</hi> Euery one of theſe gaue his owne name to that part of the country of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which he enioied for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and poſſeſſed, and of them mention afterward is made <hi>Gen. 13.14.15.23.24.25.27.34.36.38.49.50. Exod. 3.13.23.34. Num. 13.22.32. Deut. 1.2.3.4.7.20. Ioſu. 2.3.5.7.9.10.11.12.13.15.16.17.19.24. Iudg. 1.3.10.11.18. 1. King. 7.1. Chron. 1. Iud. 5. Pſalm. 105.106.134.135. Eſa. 21. Ezech. 16.27.</hi> This country was called by the name of the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> vntill the Iſraëlites, hauing partly ſlaine and partly ſubdued all the poſterity of <hi>Canaan,</hi> poſſeſſed the ſame: from which time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be called the <hi>Land of Iſrael,</hi> which name was by the Angell giuen to the Patriarke <hi>Iacob,</hi> for that he had wreſtled with God; and from thence the country grew to be called by that name, <hi>Gen. 32.28.</hi> For the word <hi>Iſraël</hi> in the Hebrew tongue ſignifieth, to preuaile with God, or a mighty man preuailing againſt the mighty God. Heere hence were the ſonnes and ofſpring of <hi>Iacob</hi> named <hi>Iſraëlites,</hi> and the country wherein they dwelt the <hi>Land of Iſraël;</hi> as is apparant out of the booke of <hi>Iud.</hi> and the <hi>1.</hi> booke of the <hi>Kings.</hi> Although the whole land of <hi>Chanaan</hi> were indeed generally called <hi>Iſraël,</hi> yet neuertheleſſe the portion or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of euery Tribe, which ſeuerally <hi>Ioſua</hi> aſſigned to euery one of the twelue Patriarkes, receiued a proper appellation of the chiefe of that family, as is apparant by diuers places of Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>The names of the Tribes were theſe, <hi>Ruben, Simeon, Iuda, Zebulon, Iſaſchar, Dan, Gad, Aſer, Nephtali, Beniamin, Manaſſe, Ephraim:</hi> and ſo the name of euery one of the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> remained in his poſterity and place of abode in the ſame, ſo that the whole land of <hi>Chanaan</hi> was diuided into twelue parts, as the holy Scripture doth teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Then vnder <hi>Roboam,</hi> when as <hi>Iſrael</hi> and that kingdome was rent into two parts, the Tribes of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> being vnited, retained the name of <hi>Iuda:</hi> and that for theſe reaſons: Firſt, for that of the two it was the mightieſt: Secondly, by reaſon that out of it the Meſſias was to come, it was the more famous, and the name of the whole was taken from the moſt honourable. But the other tenne Tribes, which were commanded by the Kings of <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſtill retained the ancient name, and were called <hi>Iſraël.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, the later part, after the captiuity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> was diuided into two prouinces, <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Galilee. Samaria</hi> the Metropolitane or chiefe city (of which the country tooke the name) was the ſeat of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But <hi>Galilee</hi> was poſſeſſed and inhabited by forreners and ſtrangers, <hi>3. King. 9.</hi> and <hi>4. King. 17.</hi> and therefore grew to be much enuied and deſpiſed of the reſt of the Iewes: ſo that they did vſe to ſpeake all villany and reproachfull ſpeaches of the people of this prouince. The North part of this in ſcorne was called <hi>Galiley of the Gentiles,</hi> and in reſpect of the ſituation, the <hi>Higher Galiley:</hi> the other part of it, toward the South, was called the <hi>Lower Galiley.</hi> Therefore after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward euen vnto the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſo foorth, the land of <hi>Chanaan</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi> was diuided into three parts, and called by three diſtinct names. The Higher country toward <hi>Sidon</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> they called <hi>Galiley;</hi> the Middle, <hi>Samaria;</hi> the Lower, toward the South and <hi>Arabia Petraea,</hi> was properly called <hi>Iudaea,</hi> Iewrie, as is manifeſt out of the ſecond chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the fourth of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> This later did containe onely two Tribes, <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Beniamin.</hi> Although alſo all the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> euen as high as the mountaines of <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> neere <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the country of <hi>Ammon,</hi> was called <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as is euident by the ninteenth chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the tenth of Saint <hi>Marke:</hi> and therefore alſo <hi>Pliny</hi> mentioneth <hi>Iudaea citerior, Iewry</hi> on this ſide <hi>Iordan. Strabo</hi> in his ſixteenth booke, and <hi>Lucane</hi> in his ſecond booke do alſo call the ſame <hi>Iudaea:</hi> which name, as we ſaid before, had the originall from the Tribe of <hi>Iuda. Ptolemey</hi> and others call it <hi>Palaeſtina,</hi> of the <hi>Palaeſtini,</hi> which according to the propriety of the Hebrew pronunciation in the Holy Scriptures are named <hi>Philiſtiim,</hi> (Pheliſtines) this Nation indeed both for their great command and warres made with their neighbours for certaine yeares together, were very famous. <hi>Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Polymnia</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> in his ſeuen and twentieth booke, calleth that part of <hi>Syria</hi> which is next to <hi>Aegypt, Syriam Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeſtinam, Palaeſtina</hi> of <hi>Syria. Ptolemey</hi> calleth it <hi>Palaeſtinam Iudaeam, Palaeſtina</hi> of <hi>Iewrie,</hi> or <hi>Palaeſtinam Syriae, Palaeſtina</hi> of <hi>Syria:</hi> Becauſe that <hi>Palaeſtina</hi> is a part of <hi>Syria,</hi> as <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> thinketh, who calleth it <hi>Syriam Iudaeae, Syria</hi> of <hi>Iudaea.</hi> Many places of this <hi>Palaeſtina</hi> are expreſſed in that his Mappe: and therefore heere they are omitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>OF AEGYPT.</hi> The country ſituate between <hi>Syene,</hi> or the <hi>Catarractae Nili,</hi> the fall or mouthes of <hi>Nilus;</hi> through the middeſt of which this riuer runneth, and by his yearely inundation and ouerflowing, watereth all the grounds of the ſame, in old time was called <hi>CHAM,</hi> of <hi>Cham</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noe,</hi> to whoſe lot this country fell when the world was diuided preſently after the confuſion at <hi>Babel; Pſalm. 78. v. 51. &amp; 105. v. 23.</hi> and <hi>106. v. 22.</hi> Afterward it was called <hi>Miſraim,</hi> of <hi>Miſraim</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cham, Gen. 5.</hi> and <hi>10. Ioſephus</hi> in the twelfth chapter of his firſt booke calleth it <hi>Merſin,</hi> which name doubtleſſe is made of <hi>Miſraim,</hi> either by contraction or ſhort kind of ſpeaking, depraued by cuſtome, or fault of the writer. <hi>Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Euterpe</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Aegypt</hi> was ſometime named <hi>Thebes.</hi> Of ſome it was called <hi>Aëria,</hi> or <hi>Aëtia,</hi> as ſome copies write it. <hi>Marmolius Theuer,</hi> and <hi>Pinetus</hi> affirme that the Turkes, and country people in and about <hi>Aegypt,</hi> do now call this country <hi>Chibth, Elchibet</hi> or <hi>Elchebitz.</hi> And indeed the Arabs that turned <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the firſt booke of <hi>Moſes</hi> into Arabicke, in the <hi>45.</hi> and <hi>46.</hi> chapters, for <hi>Aegypt</hi> hath <hi>Elchibth,</hi> from whence no doubt, the Greekes and Latines fetched their <hi>Aegyptus:</hi> like as of <hi>Phrat,</hi> the Hebrew name is made <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aegypt</hi> had three ſpeciall prouinces or ſhires; the Higher, which was called <hi>Thebaica,</hi> the Middle and the Lower. <hi>Thebaica</hi> and the Middleſhire of <hi>Aegypt</hi> which the mountaines of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and the vtter ſection or parting of the riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> at <hi>Sebemytus</hi> do define, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Higher Egypt;</hi> through the middeſt of which the riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> doth iointly runne in one maine channell: and is both vpon the Eaſt and Weſt encloſed with high and ſteep mountaines. The other Prouince, from thence euen vnto the Aegyptian ſea, is called the <hi>Lower Egypt.</hi> This alſe they call <hi>Delta:</hi> for that this country or part of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is conteined between the parting of the riuer at <hi>Sebemytus, Canopus</hi> and <hi>Peluſium,</hi> or the two mouthes of the ſame riuer where it falleth into the Mediterran ſea, neere theſe townes, is in faſhion three cornered, or triangular repreſenting the forme of the Greeke Capitall letter Δ.</p>
            <p>Theſe countries by the diſcreet aduiſe of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, were diuided into ΝΟΜΟΩΣ, that is, Shires: for by <hi>Nomòs, Nomė</hi> and <hi>Nomarchía,</hi> the Greekes do vnderſtand a ſhire and ward, ouer the which is ſet <hi>Nomárches,</hi> a Lieutenant or Lord-warden. <hi>Thebes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended tenne ſhires, and the middle prouince ſixteen ſhires: ſo that in all, the Higher <hi>Egypt</hi> conteined ſix and twenty ſhires. But in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Delta</hi> there were onely tenne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Egypt</hi> is very often mentioned in the holy Scripture: and the places where it is ſpoken of, are very famous and memorable: <hi>Gehon,</hi> that is, as ſome do expound, <hi>Nilus, Gen. 2.13. Bethſhemeth,</hi> the Sunnes houſe, <hi>Heliopolis</hi> the Greekes call it, <hi>Gen. 41.</hi> and <hi>46. Eſa. 19.</hi> This alſo is called <hi>On, Ezech. 30.

               <hi>OF ARABIA.</hi> This country the Hebrews call <hi>Arab,</hi> that is, a miſture, hotchpotch or dwelling of diuers and ſundrie Nations together in one and the ſame country, as is probably to be gathered out of the ſix and twentith chapter of the ſecond booke of Chronicles. But there being three <hi>Arabiaes, Deſerta, Felix</hi> and <hi>Petraea:</hi> we are eſpecially in reſpect of the neereneſſe and neighbourhood of it to <hi>Iudaea,</hi> to ſpeake of the later in this place. <hi>ARABIA PETRAEA,</hi> tooke the name of <hi>Petra,</hi> the Metropolitane city of this prouince and place of reſidence of their Kings. This alſo was called <hi>NABAIOTH,</hi> by the Hebrews of <hi>Nabaioth</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iſmaël, Eſa. 60. Ezech. 27.</hi> whereupon the name and appellation of <hi>Nabataea</hi> aroſe amongst the old Hiſtoriographers. It ſometime did belong to the Edomites and Amalechites, and was a part of their lands and country. Whereupon the Iſraelites by the commandement of God were conſtrained to paſſe by this country. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith that <hi>Petra</hi> the city, is of the Hebrews called <hi>Iacteel,</hi> and of the Syrians <hi>Recem.</hi> This country by reaſon of the paſſage of the children of Iſrael through it, and the great workes and wonders of God done in it, is very famous and oft mentioned in the holy Scriptures. The places of it oft ſpoken of in the booke of God, are theſe: The Red ſea, <hi>Exod. 13.14.15.23. Num. 11.14.21.33. Deut. 1.2.11. Ioſu. 2.24. Pſalm. 77.105.113. Act. 7.1. Cor. 10. Sur</hi> and <hi>Mara, Exod. 15. Elim, Exod. 15.16.</hi> There were twelue wels and ſeuenty palme trees, of which <hi>Strabo</hi> doth ſpeake, in the ſixteenth booke of his Geography. The wilderneſſe of <hi>Sin, Exod. 16. Arabia Petraea</hi> in many places was a vaſt and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible deſert, as is apparant out of the firſt and eight chapters of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> of which there are alſo diuers other teſtimonies euery where to be obſerued. <hi>Sinay, Exod. 16. Raphidim, Exod. 17.19. Horeb, Exod. 3.17.</hi> Obſerue in this place, that <hi>Horeb</hi> was part of thoſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines which the Greekes call <hi>Mélanas,</hi> that is, the Blacke hils; which are of ſuch a wonderfull height, that vpon the toppe of them the ſunne may be deſcried at the fourth watch of the night, that is, about three of foure of the clocke in the morning, an houre or two before her appearance to thoſe which dwell in the plaine. But <hi>Sinay</hi> was the Eaſt part or ridge of mount <hi>Horeb.</hi> This is proued by theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Exod. 33. Deut. 4.5.9.10.29. Pſalm. 105. Actor. 7.</hi> In <hi>Deut. 33. Sinay</hi> is called the hill <hi>Pharan:</hi> and in <hi>Exod. 18.</hi> the <hi>Holy mount.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer there is mention made of the hill and wilderneſſe of <hi>Sinay</hi> almoſt in euery chapter throughout the whole bookes of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> and in the two and thirtith chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> it is againe ſpoken of. The country round about it, is called the <hi>Wilderneſſe of Sinay, Num. 9.10.26. Amalec, Exod. 17. Num. 14.24. Deut. 25. Madian, Exod. 18. Num. 10.

Deut. 32.</hi> The <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtrife, Num. 20.26. Oboth, Ieabarim, Zared,</hi> the <hi>Brooke, Mathana, Nahaliel, Bamoth, Num. 21.

Paral. 8. Beroth, Moſera, Gadgad, Iatebatha, Deut. 10.</hi> In the three and thirtith chapter of <hi>Numbers</hi> the foure and twenty manſions or places of abode where the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in that their tedious peregrination between <hi>Aegypt</hi> and the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> pitched their tents, are recited by name. Which manſions, and encamping places of theirs, were greatly famouſed with many miracles and wonderfull workes of God, which he wrought there in the ſight of that peruerſe and froward generation.

               <hi>BETHEL, Gen. 12.</hi> Thither <hi>Abraham</hi> remoued his houſhold, after his departure from <hi>Sichem.</hi> For there is no doubt but that they are two diuers places. Firſt, it was called <hi>Luza,</hi> that is, an Almond tree, or place where Almond trees did plentifully grow. There <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw the Lord ſtanding vpon a ladder, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the <hi>28.</hi> chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Therefore vpon that accident the place was called by a new name, <hi>Bethel,</hi> that is, the houſe of God. In the ſame <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Golden calfe, that he might ſeeme in that to imitate the example of the Patriarkes and holy men before him, who worſhipped God in that place. Heereupon the Prophets changed the goodname <hi>Bethel,</hi> and called it <hi>Bethauen,</hi> that is, the houſe of wickedneſſe or villany. <hi>BETHSAIDA,</hi> the houſe of fruites, or the houſe of corne, prouiſion or hunting. Heere <hi>Philip, Andrew</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> the Apoſtles of Chriſt were borne, <hi>Iohn 1.</hi> The Euangeliſts alſo <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> haue made mention of this place, <hi>Matth. 2. Marc. 6. CANA</hi> the Greater, the country of <hi>Syrophoeniſſa,</hi> whoſe daughter Chriſt cured being poſſeſſed with a Diuell, <hi>Matth. 15. Marc. 8.</hi> of this ſee more beneath in <hi>Sarepta. CANA</hi> the Leſſer, a towne of <hi>Galiley,</hi> in which Chriſt with his preſence and miracle of turning water into wine, honourably graced matrimony. <hi>Cana</hi> ſignifieth a reed or cane. <hi>CANANAEA,</hi> it is the name of a country, ſo called of <hi>Chanaan</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cham. Chanaan</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a Merchant, and indeed the poſterity of <hi>Chanaan</hi> dwelling vpon the ſea coaſt did trade as Merchants. For <hi>Sidon</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Canaan</hi> built the city <hi>Sidon.</hi> And in the tenth chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is ſo deſcribed, as it is certaine that it contained all that whole tract of ground which afterward the Iſraelites did poſſeſſe, from <hi>Iordan</hi> euen vnto the ſea, and ſo along as farre as <hi>Aegypt.</hi> There as yet was no diſtinction between the <hi>Philiſtiim</hi> and <hi>Canaan.</hi> For <hi>Canaan</hi> alſo was ancienter than <hi>Philiſtiim,</hi> which was not borne of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but of <hi>Miſraim.</hi> Yet afterward when the power and iuriſdiction of the Nation of the Philiſtines grew to ſome heigth and greatneſſe, they cauſed the country, eſpecially all along the ſea coaſt, beneath <hi>Tyre</hi> Southward, to be called after their name <hi>PALESTINA.</hi> And in the <hi>13.</hi> chapter of the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> there are reckoned vp <hi>5.</hi> cities of the Philiſtines, <hi>Azotus, Accaron, Aſcalon, Geth</hi> and <hi>Gaza.</hi> When therefore the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites for that they poſſeſſed the places neere <hi>Iordan,</hi> were almost vtterly deſtroied, their name by a little and little began to periſh and to fade away. And although alſo the Philiſtines, which greatly enlarged their bounds and territories in that countrie, which afterward was giuen to the tribes of <hi>Iuda, Beniamin, Simeon, Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>Iſaſchar,</hi> were driuen from thence, and were for the moſt part conſumed: yet they retained, as I ſaid, certaine ſtrong cities vpon the ſea coaſt beneath <hi>Tyre,</hi> and ſo ſomewhile they greatly flouriſh and were lords ouer others: within a while after they grew weaker and were commanded of others. In the time of <hi>Abraham</hi> the ſeat and court of <hi>Abimelech</hi> was at <hi>Gerar,</hi> who in the <hi>26.</hi> chapter of <hi>Gen.</hi> is named King of the Philiſtines. The city <hi>Gerara</hi> was ſituate in that country which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> did poſſeſſe, not farre from <hi>Hebron:</hi> and was indeed placed between <hi>Hebron</hi> and <hi>Gaza.</hi> It is therefore to be conceiued that the name of <hi>Cananaea, Canaan</hi> is ſomewhat more ancient, and comprehending more Nations, than the name of the Philiſtines, which neuer poſſeſſed all that tract and compaſſe of ground which afterward the Iſraelites enioyed. But notwithſtanding becauſe the Philiſtines had certaine great cities vpon the ſea coaſt, the name of <hi>Palaeſtina</hi> was, by reaſon of their traffique, more famous and better knowen to the Greeke writers, than <hi>Canaan</hi> or <hi>Cananaea. Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Polymnia</hi> ſaith, that the Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Syrians poſſeſſing <hi>Palaeſtina</hi> ſent <hi>300.</hi> ſaile of ſhips to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and afterward he addeth that the whole country, euen from the skirtes of <hi>Aegypt</hi> vnto <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> was called <hi>Paleſtina.</hi> And therefore alſo afterward the Greekes, as <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Palaeſtina</hi> haue comprehended <hi>Iudaea, Samaria</hi> and <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> when as notwithſtanding the Philiſtines did not poſſeſſe all that large ſpace and compaſſe of ground. But often times names are giuen to countries of ſome principall prouince of the ſame, that doth in power and command ſurpaſſe the reſt. The Grammaticall interpretation and reaſon of the Etymology of the word <hi>Philiſtim,</hi> is thought to be, for that this nation inhabiting along the ſea coaſt, where earthquakes are very frequent, and ſo whole townes and cities are couered with ſand, beſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſoiled with duſt and dirt. For the word in the Hebrew tongue ſignifieth Sprinklers, or beſprinklings, as when any thing is beſprinkled and foiled with duſt: or it ſignifieth otherwiſe Batteries and ſhakings, as when a building is violently ſhaken and mooued by an externall force, whereby it is in danger and ready to fall. Like as <hi>Aſcalon</hi> and <hi>Azotus</hi> hauing their names giuen them of <hi>Eſh,</hi> fire. <hi>CAPERNAVM,</hi> that is, a pleaſant and delightfull village. Heere Chriſt firſt began to publiſh his Goſpel, <hi>Matth. 4. Luc. 4.</hi> and <hi>7.</hi> For he was a citizen of that corporation, betaking himſelfe to that place, when as he fled for feare of <hi>Herod,</hi> when he put <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> to death. Therefore of Chriſt and his Diſciples they demanded there a didrachma for poll mony, as of the reſt of the citizens and dwellers in this city. Of this city mention is made <hi>Matth. 8.11.17. Marc. 1.2.5.9. Luc. 4.7. Io. 2.6. DALMANVTHA,</hi> that is, the poore mens habitation. Chriſt with his Diſciples came alſo into this country. <hi>Matth. 16. Marc. 8.</hi>

Diuers etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies and reaſons of the impoſition of this name, diuers men do curiouſly ſeeke; I do hold this for the likelieſt, The ſacke of blood: becauſe the old opinion is, that in this place <hi>Abel</hi> was ſlaine by his brother <hi>Cain.</hi> Surely it is very probable and generally agreed vpon, that our firſt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> did firſt dwell not farre from this place. <hi>DECAPOLIS,</hi> the name of a prouince in the vttermoſt skirtes of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> and <hi>Galiley,</hi> which comprehended tenne cities: theſe, although thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, which write of them, do not wholly agree which they ſhould be, it is certaine by the iudgement of all men, were neighbour cities. And it is that country which is conteined between <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Sidon:</hi> and between the Lake <hi>Geneſareth</hi> and <hi>Caeſarea Philippi.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>EMMAVS,</hi> afterward it was called <hi>Nicopolis.</hi> And in my iudgement the Greek name is but an interpretation &amp; ſenſe of the Hebrew name, which ſignifieth the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſtrength &amp; fortitude or victory. Others haue giuen out that the interpretation of it is, the Mother of counſell. <hi>EPHRATA,</hi> which alſo is otherwiſe called <hi>Bethá<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> or <hi>Bethléhem,</hi> as our bookes vulgarly haue. <hi>Ephrata,</hi> ſignifieth abundance, fertility; a fertile ſoile plentifully bringing foorth all maner of fruites. For in the whole earth there was no place more fruitfull than <hi>Ephrata,</hi> that is, than <hi>Bethláchem,</hi> where <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Heauen</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and Redeemer of all mankind, was borne: whom the Proph t <hi>Micheas,</hi> in his fift chapter, did foretell ſhould be borne in this place. And therefore was it called <hi>Bethlachem,</hi> that is, The houſe of Bread. In the ſame place was alſo ſeated <hi>Bethhacaris, (Beth-haccarem,</hi> I thinke he meaneth) that is, the houſe of vineyeards. <hi>Bethlachem</hi> was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſoile of <hi>Dauid,</hi> where he was annointed king of <hi>Iſrael, 1. King. 16.17. GALGAL,</hi> this word ſignifieth a wheele, or a wheeling and turning about, the trundling of any thing that is round. It may be that this name was giuen to that place and roſe vpon this occaſion, for that <hi>Ioſua</hi> the captaine and generall of the Iſraelites, out of the camp heere and ſtanding garriſons, did vſe to draw new ſupplies and armies, wherewith he conquered and ouercame the enemies, and by chacing vp and down and continually vexing the nations round about, at length vtterly conſumed them. Heere the royall army and campe was continually reſident, vntill ſuch time as the whole land was diuided into <hi>12.</hi> tribes, and ſo was quietly and freely poſſeſſed and inhabited of the Iſraelites. Theſe were the firſt campes that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> the land of promiſe, and heere the Manna ceaſſed. For now they began to eat and liue vpon the fruites of the land. Heere alſo the Paſſeouer was celebrated, and all thoſe almoſt were heere circumciſed which had paſſed ouer <hi>Iordan.</hi> For they which had been circumciſed in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they were dead long ſince in the wildernes, <hi>Ioſ. 4.5.</hi> The ſame <hi>Galgala</hi> is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the <hi>1. king 11.15 2. king. 19 4 king. 4.

Hebron,</hi> oft mentioned in diuers places of Holy Scripture had many more ancient names. Of which one was <hi>Cariath-arbe,</hi> that is, <hi>Tetrapolis,</hi> Foure cities. For antiquity diuided the principall and Metropolitane cities into foure parts: (wardes we would call them) The firſt was the court of the Prince, where alſo the Counſell, the Nobility and Princes did keep: The ſecond, was for the ſouldiers and military men: The third, was reſerued for the huſbandmen: In the Fourth, the artificers and tradesmen dwelt. There alſo was the vale of <hi>Mamre,</hi> ſo called of an Ammonite who poſſeſſed it, <hi>Gen. 14.</hi> and made a league with <hi>Abraham.</hi> Heere three gueſts who went to deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrhe,</hi> were interteined of <hi>Abraham.</hi> There <hi>Abraham</hi> buried <hi>Sara</hi> his wife, <hi>Gen. 23.</hi> And therefore ſome thinke it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ciriath-arbe,</hi> that is <hi>tetrapolis,</hi> the city of <hi>4</hi> great men; for that heere were buried <hi>4.</hi> Patriarkes, <hi>Adam, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Gen. 25.35.49. IA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOC,</hi> the riuer <hi>Iaboc,</hi> that is, of emptineſſe, or ſcattering or wreſtling. The things done heere, and the hiſtories recorded are agreeable to the etymologie and reaſon of the name: for heere <hi>Iacob</hi> wreſtled with the Angell, and therefore he was after that named <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, a Prince of God, or preuailing with God. But the place where he wreſtled, <hi>Iacob</hi> called <hi>Penuel,</hi> that is, ſeeing God, or the face of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IERICHO.</hi> Some do expound it, his moone, others his mon'ths, or his ſmell. We do approue the later expoſition of ſmelling, rather than either of the two former: and that for the pleaſant and fragrant ſmell which partly iſſued from the gardens and orchyeards of the rare and ſoueraigne Balſam, a plant only growing in this place: and partly from the Palmetrees, which heere do grow in greater abundance, than any where elſe in the world beſide. And therefore in the <hi>34.</hi> of <hi>Deut.</hi> it is called the <hi>City of Palme trees. IERVSALEM,</hi> that is, The viſion of peace. It encloſed two mountaines, vpon the which it ſtood: the name of the one was <hi>Sion,</hi> vpon the which ſtood the caſtle or palace of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Now <hi>Sion</hi> ſignifieth a watch tower, a beacon. The name of the other was <hi>Moria,</hi> vpon which the temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> was built. For the very name alſo doth ſhew, that the fathers in old time did ſacrifice in that place. And <hi>Abraham</hi> lead his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to ſacrifice him to the Lord, to this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. As concerning the etymologie of <hi>mor-iah,</hi> we are contented with that deriuation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who nameth it, God ſhall ſee. Therefore let this be receiued that <hi>mor-iah</hi> ſignifieth, the beholding or the demonſtration of God. Yet other etymologies and deriuations, are not altogether from the purpoſe and to be reiected, as theſe, the illumination of God, or the feare of God. <hi>IORDANIS.</hi> A famous riuer running through the middeſt of the country, ariſing out of the foot of the mount <hi>Libanus.</hi> It hath two fountaines or heads, like vnto our riuer of <hi>Thames;</hi> one called by the name of <hi>Ior,</hi> which name in the Hebrew tongue ſignifieth a brooke: the other by the name of <hi>Dan.</hi> Theſe meeting and running together in one channell, they are called by one name <hi>Iordan,</hi> compound of the names of the ſeuerall heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MACHANAIM,</hi> that is, two camps, <hi>Gen. 23.</hi> Theſe are the campes of God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> himſelfe nameth this place. For as he returned out of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> by <hi>Gilead,</hi> the Angels of God met him. Whereupon he called this place <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> the tents or camp of God, that is, the preſence and gard or garriſon of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NAIM,</hi> a city ſo called of the pleaſant ſituation of it, as ſeemeth by the etymologie of the word: for <hi>Nahim,</hi> ſignifieth pleaſant, delightſome. Our Sauiour Chriſt going from <hi>Capernaum,</hi> entreth into <hi>Naim,</hi> and in the very gate and entrance of the city, he raiſeth the only ſonne of a widdow from death to life, and ſo turneth the heauineſſe and mourning of the mother into ioy and gladneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SALEM,</hi> was the dwelling place of <hi>Melchiſedecke. Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, that it was that towne which afterward was named <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Neither will I oppoſe my ſelfe againſt this opinion receiued by ſo many great and learned men. But there was another <hi>Salem,</hi> which afterward was called <hi>Sichem,</hi> as is left recorded in the <hi>33.</hi> chapter of <hi>Gen.</hi> as we haue touched before. Thou ſeeſt therefore how <hi>Abraham, Loth, Melchiſedecke</hi> (who was the ſame with <hi>Sem</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noe</hi>) dwelt not farre one from another. <hi>SAMARIA,</hi> the keeper of God. <hi>(Obſerue heere that our Authour miſtooke the name of a man for the name of a place: For</hi> Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah, <hi>1.</hi> Chronic. <hi>12.5. was one of</hi> Dauids <hi>friends, that went with him when he fled from the preſence of</hi> Saul: <hi>or, elſe one of the ſonnes of</hi> Harim, <hi>of the number of thoſe that had maried ſtrange wiues, as is manifeſt out of 1.</hi> Eſdr <hi>10.32. when as the city was named in the Hebrew tongue, not</hi> Samaria <hi>but</hi> Shomrom) This city was the ſeat of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Metropolitane of the tenne tribes, where their princes vſually kept their court. It was battered and laid leuell with the ground by <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> the high Prieſt of the Iewes. This afterward being reedified againe by <hi>Herod</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Antipater,</hi> was called, for the honour of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> by a Greeke name <hi>Sebaſte,</hi> that is, <hi>AVGVSTA.</hi> Heere <hi>Philip</hi> (whoſe conſorts and fellow helpers were <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>) firſt preached the Goſpell <hi>Actor. 8.5.

SAREPTA,</hi> a melting houſe, a refining or clenſing houſe: For the Sidonians which firſt inuented the maner of making of glaſſe, heere firſt erected and built their furnaces or glaſſe houſes. In the time of that great famine which raged and was ſpread all ouer <hi>Iudaea, Elias</hi> by the prouidence and commandement of God was ſent vnto a widdow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> whom he together with her ſonne preſerued from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and death, <hi>3. King. 18.</hi> Moreouer in the <hi>15.</hi> chapter of S. <hi>Matth.</hi> there is mention made of the Chanaanite woman that beſought Chriſt to heale her daughter. <hi>SICHEM,</hi> or <hi>Sechem, Gen. 12.</hi> Thither <hi>Abraham</hi> went preſently after he came from <hi>Charram</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia. Sichem</hi> ſtood in that part of the country which afterward was allotted to the tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> neere the famous mount <hi>Garizim,</hi> and not farre from whence, not many yeares after, the city <hi>Samaria</hi> was built. The word <hi>Shecem</hi> ſignifieth a ſhoulder, and the city peraduenture was ſo named of the ſituation neere the mount <hi>Garizim,</hi> But the name alſo of the ſonne of <hi>Hemor</hi> was <hi>Shecem,</hi> of whom ſome thinke this place was ſo called. This towne is oft ſpoken of in the holy Scriptures. In the laſt chapter of <hi>Ioſua</hi> it is expreſly written, that the bones of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> were buried in this place, as it is alſo in the <hi>7.</hi> chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles againe recorded. The ſame is that <hi>Sichem</hi> which is mentioned in the <hi>11.</hi> and <hi>21.</hi> chapters of the booke of <hi>Iud.</hi> and in the <hi>12.</hi> of the <hi>3.</hi> booke of <hi>King. Ieroboam</hi> built <hi>Sichem</hi> in mount <hi>Ephraim.</hi> This ſame is it which in the <hi>4.</hi> chapter of the Goſpell by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is named <hi>Sychar,</hi> the laſt ſyllable being varied whether of purpoſe or chance, God knoweth, I cannot tell. In the time of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> it was <hi>Neapolis, Naples.</hi> This is it which in the <hi>33.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> was called both <hi>Sichem</hi> and <hi>Salem.</hi> Now there was another <hi>Salem</hi> in this country, as we haue ſhewed before. <hi>SICLAG.</hi> In this place <hi>Dauid</hi> dwelt a yeare and <hi>4.</hi> months: whereupon it came to paſſe that euer after the kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> held this towne as their owne inheritance, <hi>1. Reg. 27.</hi> This city in the abſence of <hi>Dauid,</hi> was ſacked and fired, <hi>1. Reg. 30. SODOMA, GOMORRHA, ADAMA, SEBOIM</hi> and <hi>SEGOR</hi> were the <hi>5.</hi> cities ſituate in the vale of <hi>Siddim,</hi> that is, the champion vale or the vale of Salt-pits, <hi>Gen. 14.10.</hi> which by reaſon of the great fertility and pleaſant ſituation of it, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Paradiſe or garden of God, or like <hi>Aegypt</hi> the garden of the world, <hi>Gen. 13.10.</hi> In it were many ſlime pits, (<hi>bitumen</hi> the Latines call it) <hi>Gen. 14.10.</hi> In that ſame place now is <hi>Mare ſalſum,</hi> the ſalt ſea, otherwiſe called <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> the dead ſea, or <hi>Lacus aſphaltites,</hi> the lake of ſlime, a kind of liquid matter like pitch, that iſſueth out of the earth, and therefore is called <hi>Piſſaphaltus:</hi> this they vſe in thoſe countries in the laying of ſtone or bricke, in ſteed of lime or mortar. <hi>Sodom</hi> as ſeemeth tooke the name of the champion plaine wherein it ſtood. <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> of an handfull or gauell of corne. In the Arabicke tongue the theme doth ſignifie to abide, liue, or ſtay in a place, <hi>Pſalm. 25.13. Hebr. 7.23.</hi> To prolong life, to cauſe to liue long, <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the <hi>45. Azzoara,</hi> his <hi>Alkoran,</hi> and the interpretours of the Pſalmes and New Teſtament, do often vſe the word thus. And from hence <hi>Gomor,</hi> or <hi>Homor,</hi> (for ſo they ſometime expreſſe the orientall letter <hi>ain</hi>) ſignifieth <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae prolixitatem,</hi> the continuance and length of daies of a mans life. <hi>Azzoara 31.32.</hi> and <hi>36. Item Pſal. 31.11</hi> and <hi>90.9.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Magburah,</hi> is the ſame that <hi>Thebel</hi> is in Hebrew, or <hi>Oecoumene</hi> in Greeke, that is, ſo much of the earth as is habitable, <hi>Pſa. 33.81.

And ſo I thinke the more probable deriuation is to be fetched from the Arabicke, rather than from that of the Hebrew. For ſuch is the ſituation of this place, whether you respect the wholeſomneſſe and kindneſſe of the aire, or fertility of the ſoile, that before the fall it was ſo well inhabited, as no place better in all this land. <hi>Adama</hi> or <hi>Admah,</hi> red earth, the beſt kind of ſoile for carcable land. <hi>Zeboim</hi> a pleaſant and beautifull country. <hi>Zeor</hi> or <hi>Sohar,</hi> a little prouince.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the Dead ſea, or the lake <hi>Aſphaltites,</hi> becauſe we haue deſcribed it in another forme than heeretofore it hath been vſually ſet forth in, I haue thought it not amiſle in this place to ſay ſomething, for the further ſatisfying of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: For I heere do giue it this forme which I conceiue and perſwade my ſelfe it had in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> before ſuch time, I meane, as it was burnt with fire and brimſtone from heauen, by the curſe and puniſhment of God, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the wickedneſſe of the inhabitants of the ſame. For we haue made it to be a valley lying between the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, watered all along from one end to the other, by the riuer <hi>Iordan,</hi> in which then ſtood theſe fiue citities, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Gomorrhe, Admah, Zeboim</hi> and <hi>Segor.</hi> Which place why and how afterward it was conuerted into a lake, the holy Scriptures do at large and copiouſly deſcribe. <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> in the 5. chapter of his 5. booke of the warres of the Iewes, thus diſcourſeth of it: It is, ſaith he, a ſalt and barren lake, in which by reaſon of the great lightneſſe, euen the heauieſt things that are, being caſt into it, do ſwimme vpon the toppe of the water: to ſinke or go downe to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome a man ſhall hardly do, although he would. Laſtly, <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour, who came thither of purpoſe to ſee it, commanded certaine fellowes that could not ſwimme, to haue their hands bound behind them and to be caſt into the middeſt and deepeſt place of it; and it came to paſſe that all of them did flote vpon the toppe of the water, as if they had been forced vpward by the aire or ſpirits ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the bottome. Moreouer the diuerſity of the colours of this lake, which changeth and turneth the toppe of the water thriſe in a day, and by diuers poſitions and falling of the ſunne beames vpon it, giueth a luſture round about, is moſt wonderfull. In many places it ſpeweth foorth blacke lumpes of <hi>bitumen,</hi> which do ſwimme aloft vpon the toppe of the lake in forme and bigneſſe of blacke oxen without heads. But when thoſe that farme the lake do come, finding a lumpe ſo clotted together, they draw it to their ſhippes: and becauſe it is tough, being full, they cannot breake them off: but as it were binding to the boate it hangeth to the knoll, vntill it be diſſolued by the menſtrues of women, or with vrine, <hi>this</hi> Pliny <hi>in the fifteenth chapter of the ſeuenth booke of his Naturall hiſtory, attributeth to a threed ſtained with a womans menſtrues.</hi>] It is good not only for the ſtopping of the ioints of ſhippes, but is alſo mingled with many medicines vſuall in the cure of diſeaſed bodies. The length of this lake is 580. furlongs, extending it ſelfe euen vp to <hi>Zoara</hi> in <hi>Arabia.</hi> The breadth of it is 150. furlongs ouer. [Diodorus Siculus <hi>maketh it but</hi> 500. <hi>furlongs in length, and three ſcore in breadth.</hi>] The land of <hi>Sodome,</hi> ſometime a moſt bleſſed and happy prouince for all kind of wealth and commodities, but now all burnt vp, being indeed, as ancient records make mention, for the wickedneſſe of the inhabitants conſumed by fire from heauen, was not farre from this place. Laſtly, as yet ſome remnants of that wrathfull fire, both in the foundations and plots of thoſe fiue cities, and the aſhes grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp together with the fruites of the earth (which to ſee to are like vnto good wholeſome fruites, but being touched they preſently vaniſh into ſmoake and aſhes) are to this day to be ſeene. Thus farre out of <hi>Ioſephus. Tacitus</hi> in the fifth booke of his hiſtories reporteth almoſt the ſame of it <hi>Verbatim,</hi> but that he affirmeth, that the heaps and lumps of <hi>bitumen</hi> after that they are drawen to the ſhore, and are dried partly by the heat of the ſunne and partly by the vapours of the earth, are cleft and hewed out with axes. Moreouer he addeth, that this lake, in ſhew like the ſea, but much more corrupt and ſtinking both in taſt and ſmell, is peſtilent and vnwholeſome vnto the neighbours round about: againe, that it is neuer moued or driuen to and fro with the wind, nor ſuffereth any fiſh, or water foules to liue in it, as in other waters: yea it entertaineth no manner of liuing creatures, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> in the fourth chapter of his eighteenth booke, do write; ſo that, as <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth, buls and camels do ſwimme and flote aloft vpon the toppe of the water of this lake. The ſame things <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, but vnder the name of the lake <hi>Sirbon,</hi> very falſly: for it is another lake in this country different from this. <hi>Diodorus</hi> teſtifieth that the water of it is bitter and ſtinking: <hi>Item,</hi> that it beareth vp all things that haue breath, except thoſe things that are maſſy and ſolide, as gold, ſiluer, and ſuch like, although euen thoſe alſo do heere ſinke more ſlowly than in other lakes. See more of this in the ſame authour in his 2. and 19. bookes. That all vegetable things that liue not, do ſinke to the bottome: and that it will beare vp no ſuch thing except it be beſmered ouer with <hi>bitumen, (alumen,</hi> ſome copies haue) <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> doth teſtifie in the 36. booke of his hiſtory. That a lamp or candle light, will ſwimme aloft; but being out, will ſinke, <hi>Iſidorus</hi> hath ſet down, as a truth, by the relation of others. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the ſecond booke of his Meteorologicks doth write, that the water of this lake doth white cloths, if one ſhall but ſhake them well, being only wette in the ſame. Of the fruites like vnto thoſe which are wholeſome and good to be eaten, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do vaniſh into aſhes, beſide the forenamed authours, <hi>Solinus, Ioſephus, S. Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> do witneſſe. Notwithſtanding they do all affirme it of apples, not generally of all fruites. <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> to theſe addeth cluſters of grapes, in ſhape and faſhion not in ſubſtance. <hi>Tacitus</hi> writeth that this falleth out not only to all naturall things ariſing out of the earth of their owne accord, but alſo to artificiall things made by hand and ingenious inuention of man. This then is the nature and reſemblance of this place now, which was ſometime as <hi>Moſes</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.10. to ſee to, as glorious as the garden or Paradiſe of God.</p>
               <p>To theſe we thinke it not amiſſe to adioine the opinion of <hi>Nubienſis</hi> the Arabian, as he hath ſet it downe in the fifth Section of the third Climate of his Geographicall garden, imprinted in the Arabicke language, at <hi>Rome</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 1592. <hi>The place, ſaith he, where</hi> Lot <hi>with his family dwelt, the ſtinking ſea and</hi> Zegor, <hi>euen vp as high as</hi> Baſan <hi>and</hi> Tiberias <hi>was called the</hi> Vale, <hi>for that it was a plaine or bottome between two hils ſo low that all the other waters of this part of</hi> Soria <hi>do fall into it and are gathered thither.</hi> And a little beneath in the ſame place he addeth. <hi>All the brookes and ſprings do meet and ſtay in the lake of</hi> Zegor, <hi>otherwiſe called the lake</hi> of Sodom and Gomorrha, <hi>two cities where</hi> Lot <hi>and his family dwelt, which God did cauſe to ſinke, and conuerted their place into a ſtinking lake, otherwiſe named</hi> The Dead lake, <hi>for that there is in it nothing that hath breath or life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fiſh, nor worme, or any ſuch thing as vſually is wont to liue or keepe in ſtanding or running waters: the water of this lake is hot and of a filthy ſtinking ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: yet vpon it are little boates in which they paſſe from place to place in theſe quarters, and carry their prouiſion. The length of this lake is</hi> 60. <hi>miles, the breadth not aboue</hi> 12. <hi>miles.</hi> Moreouer <hi>Aben Iſaac,</hi> who in like maner wrote in the Arabicke tongue, a treatiſe of Geography (certaine frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of which I haue by me, for which I am beholding, as alſo for many other fauours to Maſter <hi>Edward Wright,</hi> that learned Mathematician, and ſingular louer of all maner literature) thus ſpeaketh of this place: <hi>The ſea</hi> Alzengie, <hi>ſaith he, is a very bad and dangerous ſea: for there is no liuing creature can liue in it by reaſon of the vnwholeſomneſſe and thickneſſe of his waters: which happeneth by reaſon that the ſunne, when it commeth ouer this ſea, draweth vp vnto it, by the force of his heat, the thinner and more ſubtill parts of the water which is in it, and ſo doth leaue the thicke and more groſſe parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, which by that meanes alſo become very hot and ſalt: ſo that no man may ſaile vpon this ſea, nor any beaſt or liuing creature liue neere it.</hi> Item, <hi>the ſea</hi> Sauk, <hi>as</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>ſpeaketh of it, which alſo is in theſe parts, and doth reach vp as high as</hi> India <hi>and the parched</hi> Zone (<hi>ſo I thinke the word</hi> Mantakah, <hi>that is, a girdle or belt, which heere he vſeth, doth ſignifie) that there is not in it any liuing creature at all, of any ſort whatſoeuer: and therefore this ſea is called</hi> The Dead ſea, <hi>becauſe that whenſoeuer any worme or ſuch like falleth into it, it mooueth no longer, but ſwimmeth vpon the toppe of the water; and when it is dead it putrifieth and then ſinketh and falleth to the bottome: yet when there falleth into it any ſtinking and corrupt thing it ſinketh immediatly and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not vpon the water at all.</hi> Thus farre out of <hi>Aben Iſaac.</hi> This ſea is of <hi>Ptolemey</hi> called ASPHALTITES, the lake <hi>Aſhaltites,</hi> of others <hi>Aſphal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> of the <hi>bitumen</hi> which it doth yeeld in great plenty; of the Iewes, MARE PALAESTINORVM, ORIENTALE, SOLITVDINIS, <hi>ſiue</hi> DESERTI, the <hi>Sea of Palaeſtina,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt Sea,</hi> the <hi>Sea of the deſert</hi> or <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> of the ſituation and poſition of it vnto the land of <hi>Iewry: Item,</hi> MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RE SALIS, the <hi>Salt-ſea,</hi> of the hot and fitiſh ſaltneſſe of the ſame, aboue other ſalt-waters, which the Arabian iuſtifieth to be true: <hi>Pauſanias</hi> that ancient and famous hiſtorian of the Greekes: and <hi>Iuſtine</hi> the abridger of the large volume of <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> call it MARE MORTVVM, the <hi>Dead ſea,</hi> of the effect: (there is ſaith <hi>Iuſtine,</hi> a lake in that country, which by reaſon of his greatneſſe and vnmoueableneſſe of his waters, is called the <hi>Dead ſea,</hi> for it is neither mooued with the wind; the heauy and lumpiſh <hi>bitumen,</hi> which ſwimmeth vpon the toppe of the water all the lake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, reſiſting the violence of the greateſt blaſts: neither is it ſaileable, for that all things that are void of life do ſinke to the bottome: neither doth it ſuſtaine any thing that is not beſmered with <hi>bitumen</hi>) to theſe both my Arabians do ſubſcribe: of <hi>Galen,</hi> the Prince of Phyſitions, it is called LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CVS SODOMAEVS, the <hi>Lake of Sodome:</hi> for him <hi>Nubienſis</hi> doth ſtand, who neuer nameth it <hi>Bahri,</hi> a ſea; but <hi>Bahira,</hi> a lake or ſtanding poole: yet contrariwiſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> termeth it <hi>Bahri,</hi> not <hi>Bahira,</hi> and by this name it is generally knowen to all the Europeans. <hi>Solinus</hi> calleth it TRISTEM SINVM, the <hi>Sad-bay,</hi> like as the gulfe of <hi>Milinde</hi> is of ſome named ASPERVM MARE, the rough or boiſterous ſea, like as <hi>Iſaac</hi> my authour, calleth this ſame lake, <hi>Tzahhib,</hi> the churliſh and dangerous ſea. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the tenth chapter of his firſt booke of the Antiquities of the Iewes, ſaith, that this place where now is the <hi>Dead-ſea,</hi> was before named the <hi>Vale of bitumen pits. Strabo,</hi> otherwiſe a moſt excellent Geographer and curious ſearcher out of the truth in theſe diſcourſes, falſly confoundeth this lake, as I touched before, with the <hi>Sirbon</hi> lake. Why the Arabian ſhould call it <hi>Zengie</hi> and <hi>Sawke,</hi> I know not. This we haue heere added partly out of the Geographicall treaſury of <hi>Ortelius,</hi> for the eaſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the Reader, leaſt the diuerſity of names might make him miſtake the thing.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou haſt, gentle and curtuous Reader, in this Mappe a draught (a plot or patterne I might call it) of the whole world, but according to the deſcription &amp; ruder Geography of the more ancient authours &amp; of thoſe of middle age. For this our globe of the earth was not then further knowen, (a wonderfull ſtrange thing) vntill in the daies of our fathers, in the yeare 1492. <hi>Chriſtofer Columbus</hi> a Genoway, by the commandement of the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> firſt diſcouered that part of the Weſt, which vnto this day had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en hid &amp; vnknowen. After that, the South part hitherto not heard of, togther with the Eaſt part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> much ſpoken of, but neuer before this time entered, was deſcried by the Portugals. That part which lieth toward the North, we haue ſeen in this our age to haue been firſt found out by the Engliſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and nauigatours; a particular view and proofe of which, thou maiſt ſee at large, in that worthy worke of the <hi>Engliſh Nauigations,</hi> compoſed with great induſtrie, diligence and charge, by my ſingular good friend Maſter <hi>Richard Hacluyt.</hi> By him <hi>England</hi> ſtill ſhall liue, and the name of braue Engliſhmen ſhall neuer die. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries which as yet do lie obſcured within the frozen Zones and vnder both the Poles, are left for ſucceding ages to find out. Peraduenture, ancient writers that liued many hundred yeares ſince, haue named ſome country or ſome one place or other, out of this our continent; but they haue not written ought of the ſituation of the ſame, as being indeed altogether vnknowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. In this continent and circuite, curtuous Reader, (that thou beeſt not caried away with a vaine and falſe perſwaſion of the knowledge of things done in the whole world) or if you pleaſe ſo to call it, within the compaſſe of that part of the world deſcribed by the old Coſmographers, all ancient HISTORIOGRAPHY, both SACRED and PROPHANE, is comprehended: in theſe all famous acts of mortall men, which from the beginning of the world euen vnto the daies of our fathers, haue been regiſtred by learned men, haue been done and performed. For euery ſtorie, before the forenamed <hi>Columbus,</hi> written in Latine, Greeke or any other language, exceeded not the limits of the Roman Empire, or the conqueſts of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, (if you ſhall only except the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels of <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus</hi> by land, into <hi>China:</hi> and the nauigation of <hi>Katherino Zeni,</hi> by the ocean ſea, into the North parts, of which we haue ſpoken in the diſcourſe to the Mappe of <hi>Mare del zur</hi>) which I make no doubt all learned hiſtorians and others will eaſily grant me. Whereupon we may ſee how maimed and vnperfect the hiſtory of the world is, when as it is very apparant that this part of the earth then knowen, is ſcarſe the one quarter of the whole globe of the world that is now diſcouered to vs. And (which is eſpecially to be conſidered, rather than to be commended) we may truly ſay that now, which <hi>Cicero</hi> in his third oration againſt <hi>Verres</hi> wrote then moſt falſly: when he ſaid of that age; <hi>There is now no place within the vaſt ocean, none ſo far remote and diſtant from vs, none ſo obſcure or hidden, whither, in theſe our daies, the couetous and bad minds of our men, doth not cauſe them go.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mmianus Marcellinus</hi> thus writeth in his foureteenth booke: At ſuch time as triumphant <hi>Rome</hi> (which ſhall flouriſh as long as men do liue vpon the earth) began firſt to grow into credit and honour in the world, that it might ſtill riſe by degrees and lofty ſteppes into a firme league of eternall peace, vertue and fortune (which often times iarre) did fully conſent and agree. For if either of them had oppoſed themſelues, it ſurely had neuer come to that abſolute height and greatneſſe. The people of this city from the firſt infancy euen vnto the laſt of childhood, which was limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted almoſt within the compaſſe of three hundred yeares, abode the bitter aſſaults and warres of their neighbours round about them: then hauing growen to a ſtriplings age and paſt the rodde, after many outragious furies of <hi>Mars,</hi> it paſſed the Alpes and narrow ſea. Being come to mans eſtate and beſt yeares, from all quarters of the wide world, it brought away the laurell the ſigne of conqueſt and triumph: but now being old and beginning to dote, and ſometime only bearing the name of conquerour rather than winning ought indeed, it hath betaken it ſelfe to a more quiet kind of life. Therefore this city, reuerend for ſo many glorious conqueſts of ſtout and fierce nations, and for ſo many good and wholeſome lawes which it hath enacted, hath now at laſt, like a kind and thrifty father, both wiſe and wealthy, committed her patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and poſſeſsions to the Emperours, as vnto her naturall ſonnes, to be ruled and gouerned. And lately, although the tribes and wardes be idle, the hundreds and wapentakes ſtill and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and there be no diſſenſions in the Senate houſe, but that the more ſecure and calmer times, ſuch as <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> liued in, were come againe: yet in all parts of the world whereſoeuer, it is regarded as a Miſtreſſe and Queen, in all places the reuerend gray haires of the graue Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, euery where the very name of the Roman Nation is greatly eſteemed and honourable. Thus farre <hi>Ammianus.</hi> Moreouer this you ſhall find in <hi>Sulpiciaes</hi> Satyricke poeme; Two things there are which raiſed great <hi>Rome</hi> to that height, valour in warre and wiſdome in peace. As this Romane Empire, in the iudgement of all men, was eſteemed very great and large, ſo alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was; eſpecially if you ſhall compare it with thoſe which haue been in former ages, as that of the Aſſyrians, Perſians and Grecians: <hi>Item,</hi> with thoſe which ſince their fall haue ſprong vp in their places, as namely, that of the <hi>Othomans,</hi> amongſt the Turkes: the <hi>Sophies,</hi> amongſt the Perſians: of the great <hi>Cham,</hi> ouer the Tartars in <hi>Aſia:</hi> and of <hi>Preſter Iohn,</hi> as we call him, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Aethiopians or Abyſsines in <hi>Africa.</hi> But if you ſhall compare it with that Monarchy which <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> within the memorie of our fathers, eſtabliſhed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts of the world, and <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonne in our age hath enlarged, and ſhall by looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an vniuerſall mappe of the Earthly globe, conferre and meaſure the greatneſſe of this with thoſe others, by the eie you ſhall plainly and truly diſcerne, that this for largeneſſe may not only be preferred farre before all thoſe other forenamed, but alſo euen before that of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the diuiſion of the world, diuers haue placed <hi>Africa</hi> in the third part: ſome few haue made no more but <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rope</hi> only; and <hi>Africa</hi> they make a part of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Saluſtius.</hi> This is that which S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> in <hi>Antonius,</hi> out o the opinion of the ſame <hi>Saluſt,</hi> thus writeth of: <hi>Europam Aſiamquè duo vel maxima terrae Membra, quibus Lybiam dubiè Salluſtius addit, Europae admixtam: poſtit quum tertia dici: Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> vaſt, the Earthly globe between them ſhare. Yet whether <hi>Africke</hi> ſhould a part of this our <hi>Europe</hi> be; or make a third part by it ſelfe, <hi>Saluſt</hi> doth doubt I ſee. But <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> alſo in <hi>Iſocrates</hi> doth diuide the world into <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe:</hi> yea <hi>Iſocrates</hi> himſelfe, in his <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricos.</hi> Moreouer in <hi>Varroes</hi> booke <hi>De lingua Latina</hi> theſe words are read; As all the world is diuided into <hi>Heauen</hi> and <hi>Earth:</hi> ſo <hi>Heauen</hi> is ſeuered into his quarters: and the <hi>Earth</hi> into <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> Againe the ſame authour in his booke of Huſbandrie writeth thus: Firſt, when as the world, by <hi>Eratoſthenes,</hi> was very fuly and naturally diuided into two parts, the one toward the South, [<hi>Aſia</hi> doubtleſſe he meaneth] the other in the North [<hi>Europe</hi> we call it.] S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> in his <hi>16.</hi> booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei: Lucane</hi> in his <hi>9.</hi> booke: and <hi>Oroſius</hi> in the firſt booke of his hiſtory, haue the like wordes to the ſame ſenſe. Notwithſtanding cuſtome ſince hath preuailed with all Hiſtoriographers and Coſmographers which haue written either in Latine or Greeke, iointly to diuide the globe of the earth into theſe three parts: <hi>Aſia, Africke</hi> and <hi>Europe:</hi> the laſt of which we haue taken vpon vs to deſcribe in this place, not only in forme of a mappe or chart, like a Geographer: but in this preſent diſcourſe, like an hiſtorian. Concerning the forme of it therefore, it is manifold, as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth. It is a <hi>Peninſula</hi> or demy-ile, and not an iland; although <hi>Silenus,</hi> as <hi>Elianus</hi> writeth, did ſometime to <hi>Midas</hi> ſo relate of it. For it is on all ſides, as you may ſee in the mappe, bounded and beaten with the ſalt ſea, but only vpon the Eaſt, where it is by a ſmall necke ioined to the greater <hi>Aſia.</hi> Yet by what limits they are there diſtinguiſhed, the ancient and the later writers do not altogether agree. For thoſe which are more ancient as <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Herodotus,</hi> and others which do follow their opinion, do diuide <hi>Europe</hi> from <hi>Aſia,</hi> by the riuer <hi>Phaſis,</hi> (a riuer of <hi>Colchis</hi> falling into the Euxine ſea, <hi>Mar maiore,</hi> or <hi>Maurothalaſſa,</hi> as the Greeks call it) neere <hi>Trapezonda:</hi> ſome mappes do now call that riuer <hi>Faſſo,</hi> others <hi>Phaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth:</hi> the Scythians, (as <hi>Theuet</hi> reporteth, <hi>Debbaſſethca</hi>) or which is all one, by that <hi>Iſthmos</hi> or neckland which is between the foreſaid <hi>Mar maiore</hi> or <hi>Pontus Euxinus,</hi> and the Caſpian ſea (<hi>Mar de Cachu,</hi> the ancient called it <hi>Mare Hyrcanum,</hi> the Hyrcane ſea) which formerly all old writers thought to be but a bay or gulfe of the Scythian or Northren ocean, as <hi>Strabo, Pliny, Mela, Dionyſius, Plutarch</hi> (in the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> and in his diſcourſe of the face in the ſphere of the Moone) and <hi>Iornandes</hi> a more late writer, haue left recorded. Yet all of them were deceiued. Only <hi>Herodotus</hi> truly (as this our latter age doth approue and find to be ſo) doth affirme this to be a ſea of it ſelfe, and to haue neither in-let nor out-let, or to be intermedled with any other ſea. <hi>Dionyſius, Arrianus, Diodorus, Polybius, Iornandes</hi> and <hi>Ptolemey</hi> haue diuided it from <hi>Aſia</hi> by the riuer <hi>Tanais (Don</hi> or <hi>Tana,</hi> as now the Italians name it) who thinketh that both the riſe of this riuer, and the land Northward from whence it commeth, are both vnknowen and vncertaine. All doubt where to place and lay their bounds: as indeed who neuer perfectly knew thoſe places toward the Eaſt and North, not being then diſcouered, but only deſcribed by them, from the fabulous reports of others: as for example, the <hi>Riphaean</hi> and <hi>Hyperboraean</hi> mountaines, which are feined inuentions of the Greekes, as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth: together with <hi>Aluani montes,</hi> heere deſcribed by <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> where now not only theſe mountaines, but alſo no other at this day, are to be ſeene: but in their places diuers huge and vaſt woods, great fennes and bogges, or large champion plaines. <hi>Orpheus</hi> alſo long ſince deſcribed in this part of the continent I meane, between <hi>Maeotis palus,</hi> the fenne <hi>Maeotis,</hi> (now called <hi>Mar delle Zabacche,</hi> and <hi>Mar della Tana</hi>) and the ſea <hi>Cronium,</hi> an huge wood. Likewiſe, <hi>Dionyſius Afer</hi> heere abouts placeth an <hi>Infinite wood,</hi> as he termeth it, from whence he ſaith <hi>Tanais</hi> or <hi>Don</hi> doth ſpring, which after many windings and turnings at laſt falleth into the forenamed fenne <hi>Maeotis. Iſidorus</hi> heere hath the <hi>Riphaean woods,</hi> in which he ſaith <hi>Tanais</hi> doth firſt take the beginning. That <hi>Donaw (Danubius)</hi> doth diuide <hi>Aſia</hi> from <hi>Europe, Seneca</hi> in the ſixth booke <hi>Natural.</hi> doth manifestly affirme; of which his opinion, what we do thinke, we will, God willing, ſet downe in the diſcourſe to the Mappe of <hi>Dacia.</hi> Hitherto we ſee the forenamed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours to doubt and diſagree between themſelues of the limittes of theſe two parts of the world: If therefore they ſhall find me a meet vmpier and arbitratour in this matter, I would, not vnfitly, and as I hope to the liking of all parties, decide the controuerſie thus: I would make the bounds, to be <hi>Tanais,</hi> or the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Don;</hi> the ſtraights or narrow peece of the maine land that is between this riuer and the riuer <hi>Rha, (Athel)</hi> which emptieth it ſelfe into the Caſpian ſea: the Eaſt branch of the ſame <hi>Athel:</hi> then from his head vnto the riuer <hi>Oby,</hi> and ſo euen vnto his mouth or fall into the Northren ſea: For by this mouth, I do eaſily perſwade my ſelfe, that antiquity did verily beleeue that the Caſpian ſea did vnlade it ſelfe into the maine Ocean. For that the name of this riuer <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> is ancient, it is very likely, for that <hi>montes Obij,</hi> certaine mountaines called <hi>Obij</hi> are placed heereabout in this tract, by <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> which he ſaith for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were called of the ancients <hi>montes Riphaei,</hi> the Riphaean hils: but then in his daies <hi>montes Alpes,</hi> the Alpes. Againe <hi>Iornandes</hi> in this continent, not farre from hence, deſcribeth <hi>Ouim,</hi> or <hi>Obim,</hi> a Scythian nation or family. And that theſe foreſaid mountaines, are in this place (not where <hi>Ptolemey</hi> and <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> haue placed them) very many men, of great credit and learning in theſe our daies, ſufficient witneſſes do ſtoutly auouch. Amongst which <hi>Baro Herberſtein,</hi> in his hiſtory of <hi>Moſcouy,</hi> is one: <hi>Paul Oderborne,</hi> in his treatiſe written of the life of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> is another: laſtly, <hi>Antony Wied,</hi> in his mappe of <hi>Moſcouy</hi> may be the third. Now they name it vulgarly by diuers and ſundrie names, but commonly they call it <hi>Cingulum mundi,</hi> The girdle of the world, as the ſaid <hi>Herberſtein</hi> doth affirme. In a Mappe of theſe countries ſet out by Maſter <hi>Ienkinſon,</hi> an Engliſhman, who trauelled through theſe parts, it is called <hi>Zona Orbis,</hi> The girdle of the Earth. Moreouer I haue in ſome ſort for this diuiſion, <hi>Iornandes</hi> and <hi>Aethicus,</hi> vpon my ſide, where they ſay that the Riphaean mountaines do part <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> Againe theſe ſelfe ſame hils, yea, and in this tract, are the <hi>montes Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei;</hi> not where <hi>Ptolemey</hi> placeth them. And they are the ſame with <hi>montes Riphaei, Obij</hi> and <hi>Alpes.</hi> Thus farre of the diuiſion of <hi>Aſia</hi> from <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth this part of the world, <hi>The Nurce of all Nations; Mardonius,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth tell of him, auoucheth it to <hi>Xerxes, To be by farre the beautifulleſt of all places of the World, to be a moſt goodly and gallant country, yeelding all maner of fruites and fruitfull trees, and thoſe in their kindes the beſt; and to be ſuch that it were pity that any king in the World ſhould haue ought to do in but he. Varro</hi> in his bookes <hi>De re Ruſtica,</hi> of Huſbandrie writeth, <hi>That it is a more temperate and healthfull ſoile than</hi> Aſia. <hi>Statius</hi> in his <hi>Achilleidos,</hi> more than once or twice calleth it, <hi>The Mighty prouince of the World. Maxima terra viris &amp; foecundiſſima doctis Vrbibus, Europe</hi> for multitude of warlike men and ſcholers deeply learned, doth farre excell —: thus <hi>Mamilius</hi> writeth of it. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the prince of Philoſophers, maketh the inhabiters of this part of the world, to be, <hi>A very ſtout and couragious people.</hi> The ſame authour affirmeth, that, <hi>All kind of beaſts and cattell heere, are in their kind, greater and ſtronger than in</hi> Aſia <hi>and</hi> Africke. But of the nature of this country, the maners and cuſtomes of the people, let vs heare what <hi>Strabo</hi> that excellent Geographer ſaith in his ſecond booke; <hi>This part is moſt fertile of valiant and prudent men. It is all generally habitable, excepting only a very ſmall portion toward the North, and abutting vpon the</hi> Hamaxici, <hi>which dwell vpon</hi> Tanais, (Don) Maeotis palus (Mar delle Zabacche) <hi>and</hi> Boryſthenes (Nieper <hi>or</hi> Dneſter) <hi>which place, by reaſon of the extream cold, is not habitable. Yet certaine bleake and mountainous places inhabited, although in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the nature of the ſoile they are tilled and manured with greater difficulty, yet hauing gotten good skilfull and induſtrious husbands, thoſe alſo are tamed and much bettered, which heeretofore were badly vſed, and kept only by theeues and out-lawes. And indeed the Greekes when they dwelt vpon the rocks and mountaines, dwelt well and conueniently, by reaſon of their wiſe cariage in ciuill matters, arts, ſciences and knowledge of thoſe things, which neceſſarily are required to the maintenance of mans life. In like maner the Romanes, hauing brought many ſauage and fierce Nations vnder their ſeruile yoke, ſeated, I meane, in places not very conuenient to dwell in, in reſpect of the nature of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, either for that it was rough and craggy, or wanted hauens, or was too bleake and cold, or for other cauſes, taught them to vſe merchandiſe before vnknowen, and haue brought them from a ſauage and brutiſh life, to liue ciuilly and more humanely. But thoſe parts which are ſituate in an equall and temperat climate, there nature adminiſtreth all things neceſſary for the maintenance of man and beaſt. Now when as thoſe Nations which do inhabite and dwell in fertile and rich countries, are maintainers of peace and quietneſſe; and thoſe which are ſeated in barren and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull countries, are moſt hardy and ſtout: it commeth to paſſe that both are helpfull one to another; while theſe do vſe their weapons for their countries defence, thoſe againe do help and maintaine them by the profits that they raiſe out of the earth, by their arts and myſteries, as alſo by their learning, wiſedome and policy: euen as in like maner alſo the dammage is mutuall and either ſide feeleth a ſenſible hurt, when the one part doth not helpe the other: yet the eſtate of the ſouldier and warlike man is ſomewhat better, if they be not one come with multitude. And the nature of</hi> Europe <hi>ſerueth very fitly for this purpoſe: for it is all diuerſly diſtinguiſhed by lofty mountaines and lowly plaines; ſo that euery where the husbandmen and ſouldiers; the politicians and the martiall warriers do dwell together: yet ſo as the greateſt number are peaceable men: which kind of life they enioy eſpecially by the meanes and labour of their captaines, firſt of the Greekes, then of the Macedonians; and laſtly of the Romanes. Therefore both in peace and warre it is ſufficient of it ſelfe to maintaine and defend it ſelfe: for it hath great plenty both of ſtout ſouldiers, painfull husbandmen, and politique ſtateſmen. In this alſo it doth excell, that it bringeth foorth paſſing good fruits, ſuch I meane, as are neceſſary for the maintenance of mans life: with all ſorts of mettall, for what vſe ſoeuer. Spices or ſweet ſmelling things and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, are brought hither from forren countries, WHICH THINGS VVHOSOEVER HAVE NOT, THEY LIVE NEVER A VVHIT WORSE THAN THOSE DO THAT HAVE THEM. Moreouer this is eſpecially worth the noting, that hauing wonderfull ſtore of cattell, ſheep and oxen; it breedeth very few dangerous wild beaſts.</hi> Thus farre the learned <hi>Strabo.</hi> Many other things thou maiſt read of this <hi>Europe,</hi> together with the nature and condition of the people of the ſame, in that treatiſe which <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the prince of Phiſitions, wrote of the care and waters. This <hi>Europe</hi> alſo, and not any other place of the world beſide, doth yeeld <hi>Succinum</hi> or <hi>Electrum,</hi> (Amber we call it, the Germanes, <hi>Gleſlum</hi>) yet it is not found in <hi>Eridianas,</hi> a riuer falling into ſome Northren ſea, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth fabulouſly report: or in <hi>Padus,</hi> a riuer of <hi>Italy (Po)</hi> as the poets ieſtingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme: nor in the <hi>Electrides,</hi> certaine fained ilands in the Hadriaticke ſea, as ſome men of better credit, and more diligent ſearchers out of the truth, as <hi>Pliny</hi>

One might eaſilier beleeue it to haue been ſo named of <hi>Europus,</hi> who, as <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> witneſſeth, ſometime in theſe parts poſſeſſed a large kingdome: which alſo I do ſee to be auouched by <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> vpon <hi>Lycophron,</hi> who maketh this <hi>Europus</hi> to be the ſonne of one <hi>Himerus. Pauſanias</hi> ſaith that one <hi>Europa</hi> was king of <hi>Sicyonia,</hi> a prouince of <hi>Peleponneſus</hi> in <hi>Greece:</hi> to him <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Chronicle doth aſcribe, who maketh him equall to the Patriarke <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; to haue liued aboue <hi>3550.</hi> yeares ſince, about <hi>1950.</hi> yeares before the birth of Chriſt. There be ſome, as <hi>Feſtus</hi> writeth, that thinke it ſo named of the <hi>beautifulneſſe and excellency of the country.</hi> Theſe we are ſure are fabulous or vncertaine: may we not therefore, as they haue formed of <hi>Phrat, Euphrates,</hi> and of <hi>Koft, Aegyptus</hi> (as we haue ſhewed before) thinke that of <hi>Riphath</hi> (the ſonne of <hi>Gomer, Iapheths</hi> ſonne, to whom this part of the world was preſently after the confuſion at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> aſſigned) they haue likewiſe formed <hi>Europa?</hi> And ſurely the name <hi>Riphath,</hi> doth very manifeſtly ſhew it ſelfe in <hi>Riphaeis montibus,</hi> the Riphean hils: item in <hi>Riphaeo fluuio,</hi> now called the riuer <hi>Oby,</hi> in <hi>Ripe,</hi> a city of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> in <hi>Rhiphataeis,</hi> the people of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth. <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemey</hi> in the ſecond booke of his <hi>Quadripartite,</hi> in my opinion much more truly, writeth that it was ſometime called by a common name, <hi>CELTICA,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a principall Nation that firſt did inhabite it. For there is almoſt no prouince in all this part, in which in time paſt the <hi>CELTAE</hi> did not inhabit. For in <hi>Spaine toward the Weſt, and beyond</hi> Hercules <hi>pillars are the</hi> Celtae as <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirmeth. <hi>Item, about the riuer</hi> Baetis, as <hi>Strabo</hi> auoucheth, <hi>the</hi> Ciltica Praeſamarci, <hi>are in the prouince of</hi> Lucenſis, <hi>and others otherwiſe named</hi> Nerij, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith: <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Xiphilinus</hi> do ſhew that <hi>the</hi> Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri <hi>and</hi> Aſtares <hi>are the ſame with the</hi> Celtae: <hi>Pliny</hi> nameth the city <hi>Celtica, in the prouince</hi> Hiſpalenſis. <hi>Antonius</hi> hath the <hi>Celti: item</hi> Celticum promontorium, <hi>is the ſame that</hi> Cantabrum promontorium, which now is called <hi>Cabo de finis terre.</hi> What Geographer or Hiſtorian is he amongst the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents that hath not made mention of the <hi>Celtebri?</hi> In <hi>France were the</hi> Celtae <hi>and</hi> Celtogalatae: and from thence are thoſe in <hi>Britaine.</hi> For that this iland was firſt peopled from hence, lying ſo neere ouer againſt it, it is a common opinion and very probable. That <hi>the Gauls Germanes were vulgarly called</hi> Celtae, all Hiſtoriographers do iointly agree: and indeed <hi>Dion</hi> doth affirme, that <hi>the</hi> Celtae <hi>did dwell vpon either ſide of the riuer</hi> Rhein: <hi>the</hi> Celtae <hi>dwelt in</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Ciſalpina <hi>(Lombardy)</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Appianus</hi> writeth. And againe <hi>vpon the Ionian ſea,</hi> (that is, the <hi>Hadriaticke</hi>) which alſo <hi>Strabo</hi> doth auerre. <hi>Silius Italicus</hi> placeth them <hi>about the riuer Eridianus (Po). In Epirus ſometime dwelled the Celtae,</hi> as <hi>Antonius Liberalis</hi> hath giuen out: <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> placeth the ſame <hi>about the mount</hi> Haemus: Arrianus, <hi>neere the mouth of the riuer</hi> Donaw: as alſo <hi>Strabo</hi> in <hi>Moeſia.</hi> The ſame authour writeth, that <hi>the Celtae are intermedled with the Illyrij and Thraces.</hi> Who alſo placeth them <hi>vpon the riuer</hi> Boryſthenes. Moreouer Ariſtotle in his booke De mundo, <hi>ioineth the Celtae with the Scythians.</hi> Heere hence the ſame Strabo and Plutarch do make their <hi>Celtoſcythae.</hi> In Plutarch, in the life of Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, I read that <hi>the Galatae</hi> (which he maketh to haue come of the ſtocke of the Celtae) <hi>paſſing the Northren ſea came vnto the Riphaean mountaines.</hi> Againe out of the forenamed Strabo I learne that <hi>the Nations dwelling Northward were in his time called Caltae.</hi> The which alſo their ancient lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which is called the <hi>Celticke or Germane tongue,</hi> doth at this day ſufficiently demonſtrate: which is the ſame (only differing a little in dialect) with that <hi>which is vſed in the ilands neere adioining</hi> to theſe places, as in Iſland, Groenland, Frieſland and others in this ocean. Plutarke in Marius wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>Celtica doth begin at the outmoſt ſea</hi> (that is, the Atlanticke ſea) <hi>and ſo ſtretcheth it ſelfe out farre into the North and from thence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fenne Maeoris,</hi> (Mare delle Zabacche.) Pomponius Mela calleth <hi>the Caſſiterides</hi> (which in another place we haue proued to belong to great Britaine, or to be of the number of thoſe which are named Brittanicae) <hi>Celticke Ilands.</hi> What is this elſe, I pray you, than plainly to affirme that <hi>THE CELTAE DO POSSESSE ALL EVROPE?</hi> Which indeed is that which <hi>Ephorus</hi> in <hi>Strabo</hi> did ſee ſo many yeares ſince: when as he diuiding all the world into <hi>4.</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſaith that, <hi>That part which is toward the Eaſt, is inhabited of the</hi> Indians: <hi>that which is in the South, of the</hi> Aethiopians: <hi>the North parts, of the</hi> Scythians: <hi>and the Weſt, of the</hi> Celtae. The ſcholiaſt of Appollonius nameth <hi>the Hadriaticke ſea, Mare Celticum,</hi> the Celticke ſea. And Lyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron deſcribeth <hi>Celtos, a certaine poole, about the mouth of the riuer Iſter.</hi> Item he placeth <hi>Leuce an iland of Mar maiore</hi> (Pontus Euxinus) <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againſt the mouth of the riuer Donaw.</hi> May we not therefore properly, as they call thoſe that inhabit Aſia, Aſians: and thoſe which dwell in Africa, Africanes: call theſe which dwell in Celtica, Celtickes? He that out of all ancient ſtories, penned either in Latine or Greeke doth not know that the Celtae are the Germanes, let him haue recourſe to the <hi>22.</hi> chapter of Hadrianus Iunius his Batauia, and I doubt not but, hauing throughly waied thoſe many ſound ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and ſufficient teſtimonies of ancient graue writers, ſhall reſt ſatisfied and ſweare to our opinion. If not, let him liſten to the Dutchmen, and he ſhall heare them call one another in their familiar communication, <hi>Kelt.</hi> The French alſo or Gauls I call a German nation. And I can proue by good arguments, if it were a matter pertaining to this our purpoſe, that the Germane or Dutch tongue is the ancient language of the <hi>Celtae,</hi> and to be the ſame which hitherto they haue vſed in all places and now is ſpoken, except in ſome places where the power of the Romanes ſo preuailed, that they baniſhed this, and ſeated theirs in the roome. It is likely therefore that the etymology and reaſon of the deriuation of the word <hi>Europe,</hi> which was vnknowen vnto the old writers, is to be ſought and fetched from no other language elſe, but from that which was moſt vſuall in this part of the world. For that the inhabitants of any country ſhould take the name of their natiue ſoile from ſtrangers, it is ſo abſurd and hard to be beleeued, that there cannot any thing more fooliſh or contrary to truth be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or deuiſed. Wherefore I thinke it good, concerning this matter, heere to lay downe the iudgement of <hi>Goropius Becanus,</hi> our countryman, who thinketh it to be ſo named, not of a woman, (which it is probable, either neuer was, or neuer came heere) but <hi>à latitudine videndi,</hi> of the largeneſſe of his proſpect (as he ſpeaketh) namely, becauſe (I do cite his owne words out of the <hi>9.</hi> booke of his <hi>Origines</hi>) it doth not only looke toward Aſia, on the Eaſt and South: Africa, on the South and Weſt: but alſo the New-found-world beyond the Hyperborei, on the Weſt and North. Neither ſhall any man perſwade me, that <hi>Europe</hi> had the name from <hi>Greece</hi> or the Greeke language, ſeeing that it was firſt inhabited of the Cimbers (<hi>Cimmerij,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Gomer,</hi> the elder brother) before it was poſſeſſed of the Greeks (<hi>Iones,</hi> come from <hi>Iawan</hi> a yonger brother, &amp; but the <hi>4.</hi> ſon of <hi>Yapheth</hi>) we make a dipthong by ſetting the <hi>5.</hi> vowel of the Latins before the <hi>2.</hi> which neither the Latins nor Greeks do admit. Therefore if ſo be at any time they would change the words in which this did light, for <hi>We,</hi> they put <hi>Eu;</hi> turning it backward. Therefore our men do term it <hi>Verop,</hi> not <hi>Europ,</hi> whereby they vnderſtand a worthy <hi>company of men:</hi> for <hi>Wer</hi> (a mono-ſyllable pronounced like a dipthong) ſignifieth <hi>loſty, great, excellent &amp; that which is beſt in euery kind of thing:</hi> which notwithſtanding ſome do write <hi>ur,</hi> without a dipthong, yet with a long vowell. Therefore, as of <hi>Terues,</hi> they formed <hi>Tereus,</hi> ſo of <hi>Werop,</hi> the Latines &amp; Greeks haue made <hi>Europe:</hi> ſo named of the excellency of the Nation, which doth farre ſurpaſſe all other men of the World. For <hi>Hop,</hi> as I haue ſhewed before, ſignifieth a company or multitude of men. More of this word thou maiſt ſee in his <hi>8.</hi> booke Thus farre out of his workes which are foorth in print: that which followeth, is taken out of a booke of his which he alſo hath ſet foorth, yet not imprinted, but ſuch as he vſed priuatly, and hath many additions in ſundrie places in the margin written with his owne hand, which he had prepared againſt the ſecond edition. But I waighing, ſaith he, and comparing this name with that which I haue read in holy Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reaſon farre more excellent, and better commeth into my mind. We ſee that to <hi>Yaphet</hi> was promiſed enlargement or a farre ſpreading of his poſterity, or as ſome other interpret the word, ioy and gladneſſe: which then he truly had enioied, when as Chriſt had redeemed vs by his death and pretious bloud (which bleſſing doth agree to this part of the world, rather than to any other vnder heauen beſide: and therefore all other countries generall do call <hi>Europe: THE KINGDOME OF THE CHRISTIANS:</hi> and the Europeans, are called of the Turkes and Arabians, <hi>GIAVVR,</hi> that is, Chriſtians.) <hi>E,</hi> therefore doth ſignifie a lawfull contract and mariage: <hi>VR,</hi> excellent: and <hi>HOP,</hi> hope: whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that <hi>Europe</hi> ſignifieth <hi>The excellent hope of a lawfull mariage.</hi> which is proper to this portion of the world which <hi>Noah</hi> gaue to <hi>Iapheth</hi> his ſonne to inhabite. For although that the poſterity of <hi>Sem</hi> was by <hi>Abraham,</hi> for many ages wedded to God, yet at length he put her away and diuorced her from him. But the wedlocke whereby God, by Chriſt is wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Europe</hi> his Church, ſhall neuer be diſſolued: ſo that <hi>Europe</hi> may moſt properly be ſaid to be <hi>Iaphets</hi> portion. But of this word we will ſpeake more in our <hi>Francica.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Goropius.</hi> Which I haue very willingly communicated to the curtuous Reader, leauing it to the cenſure of the learned to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Yet I know that theſe things haue been very bitterly skoffed at already by a certaine learned man, but one wholly ignorant of this tongue, and therefore of leſſe iudgement in this argument. There are ſome which do thinke that this <hi>Europe</hi> was in the holy Scripture called <hi>IAPETIA.</hi> Thus farre of <hi>Europe,</hi> to which before I do altogether leaue, I will ad out of <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his <hi>Polymnia,</hi> the words of <hi>Mardonius</hi> to <hi>Darius</hi> ſpoken of this country. <hi>That it is a country moſt goodly and beautifull, bearing all maner of excellent fruitefull trees, and thoſe in their kind the beſt: and to be ſuch that it were pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that any man but a king only ſhould poſſeſſe.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Liny</hi> ſaith that in the Atlanticke ocean, there be many ilands named <hi>BRITANNICAE INSVLAE, The Britiſh ilands;</hi> but the two greater <hi>ALBION</hi> and <hi>HIBERNIA, (Ireland)</hi> are properly ſo called. Of theſe, <hi>ALBION,</hi> in regard that it is both the greateſt, and as it were commander of the reſt, is moſt properly called <hi>BRITANNIA.</hi> And I might eaſily be drawen to beleeue, that all theſe ilands were recorded in the ancient monuments of the Greekes, before they were once named or knowen to the Romanes; and to haue generally been called <hi>CASSITERIDES,</hi> as who ſay, <hi>The Stannaries,</hi> and that properly <hi>CASSITERA,</hi> which the Romans call <hi>Britannia.</hi> And although I am not ignorant, that <hi>Caſſitera</hi> is held of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> to be <hi>Indica Inſula,</hi> an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an an iland, or, an iland belonging or neere adioining to <hi>India,</hi> yet I am not a whitte moued from that my opinion. For I do verily thinke that this was deliuered by them rather of ignorance, than of ſound knowledge grounded vpon the skill of Geography: and we know that this is alſo a common errour in theſe our daies, to call all countries and ilands vnknowen or farre remote and diſtant from vs, <hi>Indian iles;</hi> by which name, not without a manifeſt ignorance of the truth, they call all that whole continent of the <hi>New world,</hi> together with the circumiacent ilands firſt diſcouered and found out in the daies of our grandfathers; and ſuch alſo as daily are deſcried, they call by that name. On my ſide is <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> a man out of all doubt, of good iudgement and credit, who calleth them <hi>CELTICAS, Celtickeiles;</hi> as if they were neere neighbours to the <hi>Celtae.</hi> I do know that theſe <hi>Caſſiterides,</hi> are of others otherwiſe deſcribed; as of <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> a little aboue <hi>Luſitania (Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall)</hi> of <hi>Pliny,</hi> oueragainſt <hi>Celtiberia, (Valentia)</hi> neere <hi>Artabrum promontorium (cabo de finis terrae)</hi> by <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Ptolemey:</hi> where now there are no ilands at all; (and therefore not theſe) nor euer were any: whereupon it is apparant that theſe ilands were rather known to the ancients by name, than true ſituation. Now all men do iointly commend theſe ilands for the great abundance of <hi>Tinne</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> which they yearely did yeeld: <hi>Strabo</hi> alſo maketh theſe ilands rich in <hi>Hides</hi> or Leather. Do not then theſe three, whoſe plentifull ſtore, hath made <hi>ENGLAND</hi> at this day ſo famous all the world ouer, manifeſtly proue that they all pointed and aimed at <hi>Britaine?</hi> For what country or prouince is there in the whole globe of the Earth, that is ſo rich in <hi>Pelts</hi> and <hi>Leather:</hi> or hath ſuch plenty of fine wooll, as <hi>ENGLAND</hi> hath? The ſame <hi>Strabo</hi> affirmeth, that in the <hi>Caſſiterides</hi> they digge not very deep for mettals. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith that they are found in the very ſourd of the earth. That theſe do ſpeake both of the ſame thing, who doth not ſee? By theſe I gather, That the Phoenicians in times paſt, and Spaniards, did for trafficke ſaile through the ſtraights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> vnto this iland; and for Tinne, Lead and Pelts bring in for exchange Braſen veſſels and Salt: like as afterward the Romanes, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſubdued it, vſed to do the next way ouer land by <hi>France.</hi> Therefore it was then firſt knowen to the Romanes, by the name of <hi>Britannia,</hi> which before that, certaine ages paſſed, was very famous amongst the Phoenicians by the name of <hi>Caſſitera. Appianus</hi> a reuerend authour, who liued about the time of <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperour, writeth that the Spaniards did forbeare to trauell vpon the Weſt and North ocean, but when they were forced into <hi>Britaine,</hi> by the violence of the tide. That heere he nameth <hi>Britaine, Caſſitera,</hi> I make no queſtion: but that name was then worne out of vſe, and this, as I thinke it very likely, was growen in request and better knowne. Let the learned ſee, and at their better leiſure conſider, whether that <hi>Sextus Rufus Auienus</hi> doth not deſcribe theſe ilands vnder the name of <hi>OESTRYMNIDVM?</hi> Surely I am of that opinion he doth. For he ſaith that theſe <hi>Oeſtrymniades,</hi> are very rich of lead and tinne: and that the country people do make ſhippes of Leather, in which they ſaile vpon the maine ſea. What is this elſe then that which <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth, That the Britanes do go to ſea in ſhippes made of wickers and couered ouer with raw hides? and doth not <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>de Bello ciuili,</hi> affirme that the Britans did vſe to make the keele and ribbes of their ſhips of ſome light wood, the other part being radled with oſiers or roddes was couered with leather? This iland the Romanes, as <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Xiphiline</hi> do teſtifie, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the <hi>HIGHER,</hi> containing all that part which is toward the South: and the <hi>LOVVER,</hi> toward the North. In the Almageſt of <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> this is called <hi>MINOR, The Leſſer:</hi> and that <hi>MAIOR, The Greater:</hi> and that about the time of <hi>Seuerus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> But in the raigne of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, I find in <hi>Sextus Rufus,</hi> that it was diſtinguiſhed by theſe names, <hi>BRITANNIA PRIMA,</hi> The Firſt, <hi>BRITANNIA SECVNDA,</hi> The Second, <hi>BRITANNIA MAXIMA,</hi> The Greater, <hi>CAESARIENSIS</hi> and <hi>FLAVIA.</hi> The booke of Remembrances <hi>(Notiar)</hi> and <hi>Ammianus</hi> do adde <hi>VALEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIA;</hi> which others, as <hi>Oroſius, Claudian</hi> and <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> call <hi>SCOTIA, Scotland. Xiphilinus</hi> in <hi>Seuerus</hi> referreth the people generally to theſe two nations, <hi>MAEATAI</hi> and <hi>CALEDONII:</hi> for the names of the reſt may, as he ſaith, welnigh be reduced to theſe two. (Yet this muſt needes be falſe except he meane it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Valentia,</hi> the later part.) He that deſireth to know the ſeuerall Nations of this iland as then it was inhabited, let him haue recourſe to <hi>Ptolemeys</hi> Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, and this our Mappe, into which we haue packed thoſe things which we haue gathered heere and there diſperſed in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries, <hi>Tacitus, Pauſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> and <hi>Ammianus;</hi> and he ſhalbe ſatisfied to the full. But wilt not thou be deceiued? take the learned M. <hi>Camden</hi> for thy guide: and then I will warrant thy ſafe conduct. Thus farre of the names of theſe ilands: now let vs ſpeake in like manner of the iles themſelues, and firſt of the greatest of them which we ſaid was called <hi>Britannia.</hi>

               <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> do giue out that it is wonderfull populous: But from whence the people and firſt inhabitants came, whether they were home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne <hi>(indigenae)</hi> or come from other countries, it is not knowen as <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath written. The inner partes, higher within the land, are inhabited of thoſe which they ſay, were borne and bred there: the ſea coaſts are poſſeſſed of thoſe which came thither from <hi>Belgium</hi> (the Low countries) all of them almoſt are called by the names of thoſe cities and prouinces from whence they came, and where they were bred, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> reporteth. This his opinion <hi>Ptolemey</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, who in this ile alſo doth name and deſcribe the <hi>Belgae</hi> and <hi>Attrebates. Tacitus</hi> auoucheth that in that the <hi>Caledonij,</hi> (a people in <hi>Scotland</hi>) are red haired and bigge limmed, it is a manifeſt argument that they are come of the ſtocke of the <hi>Germaines.</hi> Their well coloured complections, curled heads, and country oppoſite to the coaſt of <hi>Spaine,</hi> do proue that the ancient <hi>Iberi,</hi> in former times had croſſed the ſea and ſeated themſelues heere. That the <hi>Galli</hi> or <hi>Gauls</hi> did enter vpon thoſe coaſts neere to their country, it is very probable by their ceremonies, ſuperſtitious opinions, and ſimilitude of languages. <hi>Zozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> in his firſt booke writeth that the Emperour <hi>Probus,</hi> ſent into this iland all the <hi>Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> that he could ſuppreſſe and take aliue, that heere they might dwell and ſeat themſelues. The <hi>Saxons</hi> and other nations which entered this land, I do of purpoſe omit: becauſe theſe were of later times and but the other day: we only determined to touch thoſe things that were of greater antiquity. Generally the inhabitants of this ile, in thoſe daies, were all vnciuill and rude: and as they were more farther remote from the maine continent, ſo they had leſſe knowledge of forren wealth and were leſſe deſirous of the ſame. <hi>That the Britans were more valiant and hardy than the Gauls,</hi> we learne out of Tacitus: <hi>that they were more taller of ſtature than they,</hi> Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo doth affirme: <hi>That they vſed ſtrangers diſcurteouſly,</hi> Horace reporteth: <hi>Claudianus</hi> the poet nameth this ile <hi>ſaeua Britannia,</hi> tyrannous <hi>Britaine.</hi> And the ſame authour in his <hi>Panegyricus,</hi> for the Conſulſhip of <hi>Honorius,</hi> calleth the people <hi>ſaeuos Britannos,</hi> cruell Britans. <hi>Quid</hi> in his ſecond book of Loue, nameth them <hi>virides Britannos,</hi> the green Britans: in the fifteenth booke of his Metamorphoſis, <hi>Aequoreos Britannos,</hi> the Britans of the ſea. They weare their haire long, all their body in what part ſoeuer being ſhauen, beſide their head and vpper lippe. The ſame authour ſaith that for nature and quality they are for the moſt part all alike, yet ſome are more plaine and ſimply minded, others more rude and barbarous: ſo that although they haue great ſtore of milke, yet they know not how to make cheeſe: others are wholly ignorant of ſowing, planting, grafting and of ſuch other points of huſbandrie. In their cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and conuerſation they are, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſpeaketh of them, plaine, ſimple and vpright, farre remote from the wily ſubtillies and crafty deuices of our men which liue more neere the Court. They fare baſely and feed vpon groſſe meats, and are wholly eſtranged from wealth and gorgeous life and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: and as <hi>Mela</hi> ſaith of them, they are only rich in cattell, and great lands and compaſſe of ground. For they do not hold it lawfull to eat either hare, henne or gooſe: notwithſtanding they keepe them, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> writeth, for game and paſtime. Yet they haue a kind of geeſe heere, which they call <hi>chenerotes, (bernacles)</hi> which they eſteeme for great dainties, ſo that in <hi>England</hi> they haue not a daintier diſh, as <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifieth. They feed vpon milke and fleſh meat, as the ſame authour ſaith. They lay their corne vp in their barnes in the eare of ſheaffe vnthraſhed: from whence they fetch and thraſh as much as ſhall ſerue them from day to day. Of their temperate and ſparing diet, together with their patience in aduerſity and affliction, <hi>Dion</hi> in the life of <hi>Nero</hi> will teach thee. That they did make their drinke, which they called <hi>Curmi,</hi> (or as now they pronounce it <hi>Courow,</hi> ale) of barley, <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> that famous phyſition, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and painfull ſtudent and ſearcher out of the true nature of medicinall ſimples, ſo many hundred yeeres, hath left recorded. <hi>Zonaras</hi> writeth that they did vſe to make a kind of meat, of which if any man ſhould take but the quantity of a beane, he ſhould neither be an hungred or a thirſt for a great time. Beleeue him that liſt. Of the ſame Britaines, <hi>Herodian</hi> thus writeth: they weare no kind of garment: onely about their neckes they claſpe a piece of iron, thinking that to bee as great a iewell and ſigne of wealth, as other barbarous nations do by gold. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith that they be clad in skins and leather. They vſed to haue tenne or twelue wiues common amongst a certaine company of them: eſpecially brothers with brothers and fathers with their ſonnes were thus co-partners: but if any of them were gotten with child, whoſoeuer got it, it was accounted to be his who firſt maried her when ſhe was a maide. Thus <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his time wrote of them. That many of them had but one wife onely, <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his ſeuenth booke <hi>de Praepar. euangel.</hi> hath giuen vs to vnderſtand: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in his <hi>9</hi> booke <hi>Recognitionum,</hi> doth auerre. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith that they do ordinarily liue till they be an hundred and twenty yeares old. They vſe braſen money or iron rings made of a certaine weight and poiſe, in ſteed of gold or ſiluer coines. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith that they vſed to weare rings vpon their middle finger. In <hi>Caeſar</hi> I read, that their houſes did ſtand thicke and cloſe together: but as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, they were for the moſt part made of reeds, or timber. They dwell in woodes like as we do in cities. For they call that a towne, when they haue with a banke or ditch encloſed or fortified a comberſome wood, whither they may flocke and reſort, to auoid the inuaſion and aſſault of their enemies: as <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his commentaries doth giue vs to vnderſtand: and there, as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith they make cabbines or cottages for themſelues, and ſtables for cattle, ſuch as may ſerue them for that preſent neceſſity. <hi>Herodian</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them a very warlike and bloudy nation. They fight not only on horſebacke and foote, but alſo with coches and waggons, armed after the maner of the Gauls; <hi>Couinos</hi> they call them, whoſe axeltrees or linces were armed with hookes made ſomewhat like to the Welch bils now adaies vſed, as <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> affirmeth; they vſe likewiſe in their warres a great multitude of waines, as <hi>Caeſar, Strabo</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> do tell vs. They fight with huge great ſwords, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſignifieth: theſe ſwords, <hi>Herodian</hi> ſaith, hang cloſe downe by their bare skinne: only ſheathed in a ſtreight peece of leather. <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> writeth that they vſed to adorne the pommels of their ſwords with the teeth of certaine ſea fiſh. They know not what a brigandine, iacke or head-peece meane: theſe peeces of armour they neuer vſe, accounting them to be but a trouble and hinderance to them when they are to paſſe ouer any bogges or fennes. For they vſe to ſwimme, runne through or to wade vp to the twiſt ouer thoſe fennes and mariſhes, and many times being bare-legged they ſpare neither thicke nor thinne: yet afterward we learne out of <hi>Dion</hi> by the oration of <hi>Bunduica,</hi> their queen, that they were wont to arme themſelues, for defence with helmets, habergions and greaus: when they gaue the on-ſet vpon their enemies the ſame authour teacheth vs, they vſed to make a great noiſe and to ſing terrible and threatning ſongs. They make warre manie times vpon ſmall occaſions and for wantonneſſe: and very often they inuade and annoy one another of ſet purpoſe; eſpeciallie for a deſire of further command and couetouſneſſe of enlarging their poſſeſſions. <hi>Tacitus</hi> moreouer affirmeth, that they alſo go in the field vnder the leading and conduct of women: for a manifeſt proofe of which he bringeth in (in the foureteenth booke of his Annals) <hi>Boudicea</hi> with her daughters. <hi>Dion</hi> affirmeth the ſame: but he calleth her <hi>Bunduica: item Tacitus.</hi> in the life of <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> writeth her name <hi>Voadica. Corpora inficiunt vltrò;</hi> they purpoſedly ſtaine and paint their bodies: (there is a very learned man who thinketh that for <hi>vltrò,</hi> heere ſhould be read <hi>nitro:</hi> with ſaltpeter) but wherefore or to what end they did it, that is vncertaine: <hi>Mela</hi> and <hi>Iornandes</hi> do thinke they did it for ornament and to ſet out themſelues: or that they might ſeeme more terrible vnto their enemies in time of ſight, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith: who ouermore addeth that they thus paint their bodies with wood (<hi>Luteum,</hi> he calleth it) which will make a blew or skie-colour. Others heere for <hi>Luteum,</hi> do read <hi>Glaſtum:</hi> on whoſe ſide <hi>Pliny</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeake, but that he affirmeth this only of the women: where he writeth that the Britans wiues and women did vſe to beſmere all their body ouer with <hi>glaſtum,</hi> (woad, an hearb like plantaine) and to go ſtarke naked to ſome certaine ſolemnities, when they were to performe ſome rites and ceremonies: in this imitating the Blackamoores. (But why I ſhould not reteine the ancient reading, which in <hi>Caeſar</hi> was <hi>glaſto:</hi> for that which now they would haue <hi>luteo;</hi> I ſee no reaſon: ſeeing that out of a fr gment of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Britaine,</hi> done by my good friend M. <hi>Humfrey Lhoyd,</hi> I vnderſtand, that amongst the Weſt Britans in the ancient Brittiſh tongue, which they ſtill ſpeake euen to this very day, by the word <hi>glas,</hi> they vnderſtand the blew or skie-colour, as alſo by the ſame they ſignifie the hearb <hi>Iſatis,</hi> th t is, woad) which is very like the plantaine.) And that the men alſo did not onlie ſtaine their bodies with ſome kind of colour, but alſo to marke them with diuers kinds of pictures, and counterfeits of ſundrie ſorts of liuing creatures, and to go naked, leaſt they ſhould hide this their painting, I read in <hi>Herodian.</hi> Liſten, thou ſhalt heare <hi>Solinus</hi> ſpeake the ſame wordes: The countrie is partly poſſeſſed by a barbarous and wild people, which euen from their childhood, haue by certaine cutters, men skilfull that way, diuers images and pictures of liuing creatures, drawen and raiſed vpon their skinne, and ſo imprinted in their fleſh, that as they
<pb facs="tcp:23194:263"/> grow vnto mans eſtate theſe pictures together with the painters ſtaines, do wax bigger and bigger: neither doth the wild people endure any thing more patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly, than that their limbes by meanes of thoſe deep cuts and ſlaſhes, may ſo deepely drinke in theſe coloures, that they may ſticke long by them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Goddeſſes, as I learne by <hi>Dion,</hi> they worſhipped <hi>Andates;</hi> (for ſo they call <hi>Victoriam,</hi> victory) who had a temple and ſacred wood, where they vſed to do ſacrifice, and performe their religious ſeruice and worſhip to her. Beſide her they had another which was called <hi>Adraſte:</hi> whether this were the ſame with <hi>Adraſtia</hi> (which ſome did take to be <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> the Goddeſſe of reuenge) which the ancient Grecians &amp; Romans did worſhip, I leaue to others to determin. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith, that in former times the <hi>Druides,</hi> a kind of ſuperſtitious prieſts, dwelt alſo amongst this people: who affirmeth, that their diſcipline and religion was firſt heere inuented, and from hence caried beyond ſea into <hi>France.</hi> That they continued vntill the time of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Mona</hi> or <hi>Angleſey,</hi> it is apparent out of the <hi>14</hi> booke of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> his Annals. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, doubtleſſe, this nation had their knowledge of the ſtate &amp; immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoule after this life: for this was the opinion of thoſe <hi>Druides,</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> and others haue written of them. But of the <hi>Druides,</hi> we will, God willing, ſpeake more in our <hi>Old France,</hi> or <hi>Gallia</hi> as it ſtood in <hi>Caeſars</hi> time. That the Britans did ſo greatly eſteeme and wonderfully extoll the art Magicke, and performe it with ſuch ſtrange ceremonies, that it is to be thought that the Perſians had it from hence, I haue <hi>Pliny</hi> for my patron, who mightily perſwadeth me. The forenamed <hi>Bunduica,</hi> alſo doth ſeeme to iuſtifie the ſame: who, as ſoone as ſhe had ended her oration vnto her army, caſt an hare out of her lappe, by that meanes to geſſe what the iſſue of that iourney would be: which after that ſhe was obſerued to goe on forward, all the company iointly gaue a ioifull ſhout and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation. To ſacrifice and offer the blood of their captiues vpon their altars, and to ſeeke to know the will and pleaſure of their Gods by the entrails of men, as the Romans did by the bowels of beaſts, theſe people held it for a very lawfull thing.

(Yet we know by experience that this is all falſe: for ſuch is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit number of bees in this country, that they are not only to be found heere in hiues and bee-gardens, but alſo abroad in the fields in hollow trees and holes of the ground.) The temperature of the aire (ſaith <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi>) is very vnkind and vnfit for the ripening of corne and graine: but the ſoile is ſo good for graſſe, not only great and ranke, but alſo ſweet and wholeſome, that their heards and cattell do fill themſelues in ſo ſhort a time, that if they be not driuen out of the paſture, they will feed while they burſt. <hi>Solinus</hi> affirmeth the ſame, but in fewer words.

It beareth great plenty of <hi>Hempe</hi> and <hi>Flax.</hi> The ſoile is reaſonably fertile, either for <hi>Corne</hi> or <hi>Graſſe:</hi> and therefore it yeerely yeeldeth both great plenty of <hi>Barly, Wheat</hi> and <hi>Rie,</hi> but eſpecially of <hi>Oats,</hi> whereof they for the moſt part, make their bread, &amp; maintaineth great ſtore of <hi>cattel,</hi> and many flocks of <hi>ſheepe,</hi> but that aſwell the one as the other are leſſe than they be in <hi>England.</hi> They burne Seacole, inſteed of wood, of which they haue none or very little. Vpon the South coaſt lieth a ſmall ile, which they call <hi>The calfe of Man,</hi> where there is ſuch wonderfull plenty of ſea fowles, which they call <hi>Puffins,</hi> and of thoſe geeſe, which we call <hi>Bernacles, Clakes</hi> or <hi>Soland geeſe,</hi> as none which haue not ſeene them, will eaſily beleeue. Thus farre of <hi>Mona,</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Caeſar;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mona,</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> do ſpeake of, now followeth.</p>
               <p>That which we now call <hi>ANGLESEY</hi> that is, <hi>The Engliſh ile, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Dion,</hi> as I ſaid, called <hi>Mona:</hi> the Welchmen, <hi>Mon, Tir-mon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Inis Dowyl,</hi> that is, <hi>The darke ile;</hi> the Saxons, <hi>Monege:</hi> a very goodly and fruitfull iland, the ancient ſeat of the Druides, was brought in ſubiection vnder the Romane Empire, by <hi>Paullinus Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> about <hi>46.</hi> yeeres after the birth of Chriſt. It is very neere the coaſt of <hi>Britaine,</hi> as <hi>Dion</hi> ſaith: yea ſo neere that from the main, by ſwimming ouer the flattes and ſhallow places, <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> witneſſeth, conueied in thither both horſemen and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to ſuppreſſe certaine rebels that held it againſt the Romans. But of this iland there is in this our Theater, a whole diſcourſe written by <hi>Humfrey Lloyd,</hi> a learned gentleman, &amp; painfull ſtudent in the Britiſh ſtories. Vpon the coaſt of <hi>Wales</hi> alſo lieth <hi>BERDSEY,</hi> that is, <hi>The birds Ile,</hi> called of the Britans <hi>Enhly:</hi> of <hi>Ptolemey, Edry;</hi> of <hi>Pliny, Andros</hi> or <hi>Adros:</hi> a plaine and champion country toward the Weſt, but in the Eaſt very hillie and mountainous. Then <hi>GRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOLME,</hi> and <hi>STOCHOLME</hi> excellent paſtorage, paſſing pleaſant by reaſon of the ſweet ſmell of the wild Tyme which heere groweth euery where in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Next to theſe is <hi>SCALMEY,</hi> as fertile as any, called of <hi>Pliny, Silimnus:</hi> of <hi>Ptolemey, Limi:</hi> and in the catalogue of Martyrs, <hi>Lemeneia Inſula.</hi> In the mouth of <hi>Seuern,</hi> lie the <hi>Holmes,</hi> or as the Welchmen call them, the <hi>Echni, FLATHOLME</hi> and <hi>STEEPHOLME (Reoric,</hi> in Welch) <hi>Item, BARREY, SILEY, CALDEY</hi> and <hi>LONDEY,</hi> ſmall Ilands, but very fertile. Thirty or forty miles off Weſt from the Cape of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> which the ſeamen commonly call, The lands end, lie the <hi>SORLINGS</hi> or the <hi>SYLLY;</hi> called by <hi>Sulpitius Seuerus, Sillinae;</hi> of <hi>Antonine, Sigdeles:</hi> of <hi>Solinus, Silurae,</hi> or <hi>Silurum Inſulae:</hi> the Grecians, of their ſituation, named them <hi>Heſperides,</hi> the Weſt iles: and of their rich commoditie of Tinne <hi>(Caſſiteros)</hi> which they yeeld, <hi>Caſſiterides,</hi> the Stanneries: but why <hi>Feſtus Auianus</hi> ſhould name them <hi>Oſtrimnides,</hi> I know not. They are in all <hi>145.</hi> beſide craggie rockes which are innumerable. There are <hi>10.</hi> of them, which alſo <hi>Euſtathius</hi> doth teſtifie: <hi>S. Mary, Annoth, Agnes, Sampſon, Silly, Brefer, Ruſco,</hi> (or <hi>Triſcraw) S. Hellen, S. Martine</hi> and <hi>Arthur,</hi> with <hi>Minanwitham,</hi> and <hi>Minuiſiſand,</hi> greater and more famous then the reſt for their rich veines of Tinne: from whence, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, <hi>Medacritus</hi> firſt brought <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Tinne</hi> into <hi>Greece.</hi> Many of them are good <hi>corne ground:</hi> all of them infinite ſtore of <hi>Conies, Cranes, Swannes, Herons,</hi> and other <hi>Sea-fowle.</hi> Theſe are thoſe ilands as <hi>Solinus</hi> writeth which a tempeſtuous frith, of two or three houres ſaile ouer, doth part from the outmoſt end of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall (Danmoniorum ora)</hi> whoſe inhabitants doe ſtill obſerue the ancient cuſtomes: they keepe no faires or markets: they care not for mony: they giue and receiue ſuch as one another haue neede of: they rather regard more to get neceſſary things for exchange, than thoſe of high price and great valew: they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deuout in their religious ſeruices to their Gods: and both women and men in like manner do hold themſelues to be very skilfull in foretelling of things to come.</p>
               <p>Vpon the coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> ouer againſt <hi>Normandy,</hi> are <hi>GERSEY (Caeſarea, Antoninus</hi> calleth it) a fertile ſoile, good corne ground, and reaſonable paſtorage: it hath <hi>12.</hi> pariſhes, wel inhabited and very populous: <hi>Item, GARNSEY, SERKE, ALDERNEY, ARME,</hi> the <hi>QVASQVETS</hi> and others, which although the ancients did neuer reckon amongst the number of the Brittiſh iles, yet we know that they are now ſubiect to the crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and euer haue beene ſince the yere of our Lord <hi>1108.</hi> at what time they were by <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, annexed to this kingdome. They are all in the dioceſſe and iuriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cloſe to the ſhore of <hi>England</hi> is the ile of <hi>WIGHT, (Ptolemey</hi> calleth it <hi>Wicteſis; Pliny</hi> &amp; <hi>Suetonius, Vectis;</hi> the <hi>Panegyricus</hi> &amp; <hi>Eutropius, Vecta; Diodorus, Icta,</hi> all deriued from the Brittiſh word <hi>Guith,</hi> which ſignifieth a deuiſion, or ſeparation; for that it was once ioined, as then they vulgarly held, vnto the maine land: like as <hi>Sicilia</hi> was to <hi>Italy.</hi>) It is <hi>20.</hi> miles long, &amp; <hi>12.</hi> miles broad. <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> firſt brought it vnder the obedience of the Romans, in the raigne of the emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth in the fourth chapter of his <hi>Veſpaſianus:</hi> yet <hi>Eutropius</hi> affirmeth it to be done by <hi>Maximianus</hi> the emperor. It is by the ſea, which entreth vp high within the land, diuided into two prouinces: <hi>Freſh-water ile</hi> and <hi>Binbridge ile.</hi> In <hi>Bedaes</hi> time it conteined but <hi>1200.</hi> families, now it hath <hi>36.</hi> pariſhes, villages &amp; caſtles, which do belong all to <hi>Hantſhire,</hi> and are of the dioceſſe <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> The ſoile is very fertile either for corne or cattel. Beſide many flocks of ſheep of paſſing fine wool, it is wonderfully ſtored with <hi>Conies, Hares, Patridges</hi> &amp; <hi>Pheſants.</hi> In the time of <hi>William</hi> the firſt, <hi>William Fitz-osbern</hi> was intituled <hi>Lord of Wight,</hi> and after that <hi>Henry Beauchamp</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> was by King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, crowned <hi>King of Wight.</hi> See more of it in <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Beda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ile <hi>TENET,</hi> lying hard to the coaſt of <hi>Kent,</hi> of eight miles length, &amp; fower miles breadth, is a chalkie ſoile, and paſſing good corne ground. <hi>Solinus</hi> calleth it <hi>Thanatos,</hi> or as ſome copies haue, <hi>Athanatos,</hi> &amp; thus he writeth of it: The ile <hi>Thanatos (Tenit)</hi> waſhed by the French ocean: &amp; diſioined from <hi>England,</hi> the main continent, by a narrow frith, is a very rich corne ground &amp; fat ſoile: neither is it only good and kind to it ſelfe, but alſo to other places: for as in it no ſnake or venemous ſerpents do breed or liue, ſo the earth &amp; duſt, caried from thence, to what place of the world ſoeuer, doth naturally kill ſuch vermine: Thus far <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> then: but that which he ſpake of it concerning Serpents, we now in our daies know by experience to be falſe. Neere to this is that ſhallow ſandy place, ſo dangerous to ſea-men, commonly called <hi>GOODVVINS SANDS,</hi> an iland ſometime the poſſeſſion of Earle <hi>Goodwin,</hi> which as our hiſtories report, did ſinke in the yeere of our Lord <hi>1097.</hi> This ſhould ſeeme to be <hi>Toliapis,</hi> of <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> but that he placeth it neere to Eſſex or the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> when as this lieth a great deale more neere the <hi>Cantij.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within the Thames mouth are yet other two ilands, one vpon Kent ſide, which now we call <hi>SHEPEY,</hi> that is, <hi>the ile of ſheep,</hi> but how it was called of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients we certainly know not: The other vpon Eſſex ſide, which <hi>Ptolemey</hi> in his time called <hi>CAVNA, CONVENNOS</hi> or <hi>COVNOS</hi> (ſuch is the variety of copies) is ſtill called <hi>Conway.</hi> It lieth ſo flat and low that it is ſometime all ouerflowen, excepting ſome little knols and hils whither the cattle do ordinarily flie in ſuch like danger. It feedeth yerely four thouſand ſheepe at the leaſt, whoſe fleſh is of a moſt ſweet and pleaſant taſte ſurpaſſing thoſe of other places. Thus hauing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo many troubleſome and dangerous ſeas, and now being come within kenning of mine owne natiue country, I thinke it not amiſſe to put into harbrough heere for awhile, to reſt our wearied limmes, and purge vs from thoſe brackiſh humours which in this tedious iourney we drunke in. Thus farre then of the ilands deſcribed and named in this Mappe. Yet there are certaine others mentioned in ſome authours of good note. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> giueth out, that there are many ilands neere to <hi>Britain,</hi> waſte and deſert: whereof ſome, he ſaith, are dedicated to the gods and famous worthies. Amongst theſe there is one, in which he ſaith, they report, <hi>Saturne</hi> lulled a ſleepe by <hi>Briareus,</hi> is kept as priſoner in chaines: he is bound, I ſay, with ſleep in ſted of a chaine: and hath many Angels and demy-gods for ſeruants to wait and attend vpon him. Whether this be that which that <hi>Auienus</hi> calleth <hi>Pelagia,</hi> and affirmeth to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to <hi>Saturne,</hi> I dare neither conſtantly affirme, nor peremptorily deny. Moreouer, of theſe ſame thou maiſt read ſomething worth the while as not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnpleaſant, though doubtleſſe meerly fabulous, in the ſame <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>De defectu Oraculorum,</hi> of the ceaſing of oracles: as alſo in <hi>Iſacius Tzetzes,</hi> vpon <hi>Lycophron. Artimedorus</hi> in <hi>Straboes</hi> Geography ſaith, that there is an iland neere <hi>Britaine,</hi> where they offer ſacrifice to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> in the ſelfe ſame manner and with like ceremonies, as they do in <hi>Samothrace. Apollonius,</hi> in his Hiſtory of ſtrange and wonderfull things, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of <hi>Cytinus Chius,</hi> that there is a certaine Brittiſh ile (not <hi>Britaine</hi> it ſelfe, as <hi>M. Camden</hi> vnderſtandeth him) <hi>400.</hi> furlongs in compaſſe, where fruits doe grow without ſtones or kernels: for you ſhall neither find a ſtone in the oliue, nor kirnell in the grape: which alſo happeneth not only to theſe <hi>2</hi> fruites, but alſo to all other of thoſe kinds. But this is more like a feigned tale, then a true ſtory. Moreouer <hi>Dionyſius Afer</hi> nameth the <hi>NESIADES,</hi> the ſeat and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the <hi>Ammitae,</hi> amongſt the number of the Brittiſh iles: but I would rather iudge theſe to be ilands vpon the coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> than Brittiſh iles, and that by the authority of <hi>Strabo.</hi> If any man do deſire to know theſe better, let him repaire to the learned <hi>Claurencieux Camden,</hi> my ſingular good friend, who hath in that his <hi>Britannia,</hi> (a worthy worke compoſed by him, with infinte paines and trauell) ſo learnedly and diligently deſcribed and ſet downe their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forme, cuſtomes, maners, places and cities, together with thoſe of later times, and of theſe our daies, that they rather ſeeme to be expreſſed to the eie in their true colours, by the pencill of a skilfull painter, then by the pen of a painfull ſtudent. But ſome man may ſay, this is written in the Latine tongue, a language that I vnderſtand not. Be patient a while. Thou ſhalt heare him ſpeake ſhortly good <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Of mine owne knowledge he is already put to ſchoole, for that purpoſe into the country to the learned <hi>Philemon Holland.</hi> If thou knoweſt him not: that learned Doctor of Phyſicke, who lately taught the great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Pliny</hi> of <hi>Como;</hi> &amp; the renowmed Hiſtorian, great <hi>Liuy</hi> of <hi>Padua;</hi> two Italians that neuer could ſound a word of ours before, to ſpeake Engliſh ſo plainly and well, as neuer none better. No ſtranger, nay no man, euer ſpake more properly, none more eloquently. When he beginneth (I know it will not be long) we ruder clownes, will hold our peace. But we cannot forget the worthy paines of the learned <hi>M. Verſtegan,</hi> who hath giuen vs good cauſe to remember him with thanks, for that his <hi>Reſtitution of decaied intelligence,</hi> in antiquities concerning the renowmed Engliſh Nation, lately imprinted and dedicated to his moſt exellent Maieſty.</p>

            <p>Without the limits of the maine land or continent of Spaine, there is a part of this country called <hi>INSVLARIS,</hi> or <hi>BALEARIVM,</hi> that is, The Spaniſh iles, or, the Baleares. For this part of Spaine conſiſteth altogether of ilands. The names of thoſe which do lie in the Ocean or Maine ſea, are theſe, <hi>GADES</hi> (now <hi>Caliz) IV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NONIS inſula, GERYONIS monumentum, (S. Pedro,</hi> a little ile betweene Caliz and the maine land) <hi>LONDOBRIS,</hi> ouer againſt Portugall, now knowen by the name of <hi>Barlinguas; CORTICATA, AVNIOS, DEORVM inſulae,</hi> peraduenture thoſe which they now call <hi>Iſlas de Baiona;</hi> and the faigned <hi>CASSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERIDES,</hi> in this tract. For theſe famous ilands are indeed thoſe which our ſeamen call <hi>The Sorlings,</hi> belonging to the crowne of England, as we haue ſhewed before. In the Midland ſea are theſe following: the two <hi>BALEARES,</hi> the Greater and the Leſſer <hi>MALLORCA</hi> and <hi>MENORCA:</hi> the two <hi>PITYVSAE,</hi> to wit, <hi>EBV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS,</hi> (now <hi>Yuica,</hi> or as ſome terme it <hi>Ibiſſa</hi>) and <hi>OPHIVSA; SCOMBRARIA (Cabo di Palos) COLVBRARIA, (Moncolobrer) CAPRARIA (Cabre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra) TIQVADRA (Coneiera) PLVMBARIA, PLANESIA,</hi> and <hi>MAENARIA,</hi> all of them, except only the Baleares and Gades, ſmall ilands and of none ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Gades was much renowmed and famous long ſince by meanes of the fables of Hercules and Geryon feigned by Poets to haue been acted heere, as alſo for that the long liued king Arganthonius, who was before his death <hi>300.</hi> yeares old, did ſometime keepe his court heere. The Baleares were much talked of, by reaſon the Ilanders were counted good ſlingers, beſt experienced and skilfull in that weapon called by the Romanes, <hi>Funda.</hi> But eſpecially it was much ſpoken of by meanes of the great famine and dearth that there was cauſed by conies: of which there was ſometime in theſe Ilands ſuch wonderfull ſtore and abundance, that old ſtories do teſtifie, that the country people were forced to entreat of Auguſtus Caeſar a military aid and band of men to helpe to deſtroy them, keepe them from breeding and ſpreading any further. Pliny compareth the winds of theſe Ilands with the beſt that are made of Italian grapes. I do verily beleeue that Seruius vpon the <hi>7.</hi> booke of Virgils Aeneids did miſtake the matter, when he writeth that Geryon did rule as king of the Baleares, and the Pityuſaes. For all other writers do affirme, that he reigned and kept his court about Gades. Except in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Seruius one ſhould alledge this ſaying of Trogus: <hi>In parte Hiſpaniae quae ex inſulis conſtat, regnum penes Geryonem fuit:</hi> that is, In a part of Spaine which conſiſteth altogether of ilands, Geryon ſwaied the ſcepter, and ruled as ſoueraigne king. But that he ſpake this of Gades, and the iland, not farre from it in the maine ſea, the wonderfull paſtorage and rankeneſſe which he aſcribeth to theſe is a ſufficient argument and proofe; which by no meanes may be verified of the Baleares. Againe, Solinus plainly teſtifieth for me that Bocchoris, and not Geryon, did reigne in the Baleares. But his owne words may perhaps pleaſe thee better; therefore liſten, thus he ſpeaketh: <hi>Bocchoris regnum Baleares fuerunt, vſ<expan>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll that tract of the earth, which the Ocean, the midland ſea, the Pyreney mountaines and the riuer Rheine do containe and compaſſe, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of old wtiters GALLIA or GALACIA, and the inhabitants CELTI or CELTAE. Whereupon Ptolemey properly named it CEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOGALACIA. We haue demonſtrated and ſhewed at large in the olde map of Europe, that the name <hi>Celtes</hi> was more generall in times paſt: and that <hi>Gallia</hi> did reach beyond the Alpes as farre as the riuer Rubicon; becauſe indeed that part of Italy (as we know) was poſſeſſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by them. But we purpoſe heere onely to deſcribe that which is properly and truly called <hi>Gallia,</hi> whoſe bounds we haue ſet downe to be the Ocean, the Rhine and the mountaines. This the Romanes diuided into GALLIA TRANSALPINA, that is, Gallia beyond the Alpes and GALLIA CISALPINA, that is, Gallia on this ſide the Alpes. Mela and Plinic diuided it into two parts, the one lying Northward, the other Southward: this Pliny and his imitatour Solinus by the two hils Gebenna and lura: Mela by the hill Gebenna and the riuer Rhoſne: after whch maner alio Entropius and Suetonius do diſtinguiſh it. They call that part, which is toward the North GALLIA COMATA; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inhabitants did weare long haire: the other toward the South GALLIA BRACCATA, of a ſhort kind of coat, which the people of that countrie did commonly goe in. The whole is diuided of Caeſar into three parts: of the which one (ſaith he) is inhabited by the BEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAE, another by the AQVITANI, and the third by them, who in their tongue are called CELTAE, and in ours GALLI. The riuer Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronde parteth the Celtes from the Aquitanes, and the riuers Seine and Marne doe diuide them from the Belgae. But GALLIA NARBO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NENSIS is not mentioned in this diuiſion: which part Pliny and Pomponius Mela do deſcribe ſeuerally by it ſelfe, and Caeſar comprehendeth it vnder the name of PROVINCE. Notwithſtanding Ptolemey in his deſcription, and Ammianus, who followeth him, doth attribute it vnto Gallia, and diuide the whole into foure parts, to wit, AQVITANIA, LVGDVNENSIS (the very ſame with <hi>Celtica</hi>) BELGICA and NARBONENSIS. But all doe not limite this diuiſion with the ſame bounds. For Caeſar placeth the <hi>Heluetians</hi> next to the Gaules or Celtes, whom Pliny and the foreſaid Ptolemey place in Belgica. Caeſar maketh Belgica to reach from the Rhine to Marne, Pliny from the riuer Scaldis to the Seine. Caeſar placeth the riuer Garonde as the bound betweene the Celtes and the Aquitanes, ſo likewiſe doth Pomponius Mela; but Strabo boundeth it with the riuer Loire, and that according to the preſcript of Auguſtus, with whom alſo Ptolemey doth agree. The foreſaid Strabo (following I know not what authors) ſaith that the Belgae inhabite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Rhine and the Ocean and amongſt them numbreth the Veneti, the vtmoſt people that dwell towards the Weſt ſea. But I feare much, leſt in that place in ſted of Belgae he ſhould haue ſaid Celtae, ſeeing that according to all Geographers and Hiſtoriographers the people Veneti are placed in Gallia Celtica or Lugdunenſis. Succeeding ages diuided the whole country of Gallia into many parts, as we may read in Sextus Rufus, Ammianus, a booke intituled Liber Notitiar: and another called Dignitatum Libellulus, which authors doe reckon all the parts and regions thereof to bee ſeuenteene; all which we offer to thy view in this our map. But afterward in proceſſe of time, to wit, after the time of Charlemaine it was diuided only into two parts the one AVSTRASIA, that is, Eaſt France, the other NEVSTRIA (as they corruptly write it) or <hi>Veſtria</hi> or rather <hi>Weſtria,</hi> that is, Weſt France. And ſo much concerning the name of this countrie, the limitation and the bounds, which Suetonius in the life of Iulius affirmeth to containe in compaſſe 32. hundred miles. Now it remaineth that we write ſomewhat in like maner of the nature, temperature and commodities of the ſame.</p>

            <p>They agree in this one property with the ſnow of their country: for aſſoone as they are hot in battell, preſently they ſweat extremely. And if they ſtirre ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo little they melt like ſnow in the Sunne. Or, this of Dion? The Gauls are carried with vnſatiable luſt to performe all matters whatſoeuer they go about, in ſo much that they know no meane either of boldneſſe or of feare, but one while they fall of a ſudden from boldneſſe into fearefulneſſe; and by and by from feare into deſperate raſhneſſe. Or this iudgement of Strabo which he giueth of them? It is a warlike and fierce nation, very forward in fight. Therefore being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to battell they fight vpon heapes thronging together and do lie very open: and that very vncircumſpectly. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily entrapped, it their enemy vſing but ſome ſtratageme, at his beſt aduantage, doe traine them out to ioine battell, being appointed and armed with nothing beſide ſtrength and deſperateneſſe. Leo the Emperour in his booke <hi>De Bellico apparatu,</hi> determineth of them farre otherwiſe. The Frenchmen (ſaith he) are ſtout of courage, valiant in warre. To be faint harted and to giue ground neuer ſo little they account a great diſgrace, and do eſteeme it no better than running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way &amp;c. Now then if this nation be ſo womaniſh and cowardous, ſo vnpatient of labour, ſo vnconſtant and vnable to hold out in battell, doe but tell me (O thou Romane) why Cicero in his oration <hi>Pro Prouincijs Conſularibus,</hi> did write that this Gallia was ſo terrible vnto thee? Why did Saluſt affirme that all Italy did tremble and quake for feare of this people; in ſo much, that the Romanes did not vſe to contend with them for glory and ambition, but only for ſafegard of their liues and country? How happeneth it, that in Trogus we find theſe words of the kings of the Eaſt? There was ſo great a terrour of the French name, and of their ſucceſſe in all warres ſo proſperous; that theſe ſuppoſed themſelues neuer able to keepe either their maieſty out of danger, nor to recouer it againe, being decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or loſt, without the helpe of the French valour and proweſſe. And why doth Appian, in his ſecond booke of Ciuill warres, ſay, that they did ſtrinke ſuch a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to the Romanes, that in the law, wherein freedome from ſeruice in warre was granted to Prieſts and old men, the French warres were only excepted? So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipater, out of Varro his ſecond booke of Antiquities, gathereth, that the Gauls did moſt ingeniouſly affect two things, to wit, militarie knowledge, and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

Concerning their warefare take theſe few things gathered out of ancient writers: and firſt out of Caeſar. This is the maner of the Gals (ſaith he) when they begin any warres they appoint a generall muſter, to which by a common law, all the yong ſtriplings are compelled to come in their armour: and he that commeth laſt of all, is in the open ſight of all the reſt, with all kind of moſt cruell torments, put to death. Out of Strabo: Their armour according to their ſtature is a long ſword hanging on the right ſide, along target, ſpeares ſutable thereunto (which Diodorus reporteth to bee headed with iron, a cubite or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in length, and little leſſe than two handfuls broad) and a kind of iaueling called <hi>Meris,</hi> or rather, as ſome learned men do affirme, <hi>Materis,</hi> and to bee the ſame with that kind of weapon which Caeſar calleth <hi>Matara.</hi> Some of them alſo vſe bowes and ſlings. They haue moreouer another weapon of wood in forme of a dart, which they fling not with a thong faſtned to the middle, [as the Iriſhmen at this day vſe] but meerly with the bare hand, &amp; yet for all that they will throw it further than an archer can ſhoote. Nonius out of Varro maketh mention of a kind of weapons, proper to the Frenchmen, called <hi>Geſa,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Qui gladijs cincti ſiue ſcuto cum binis geſis.</hi> That is, which were armed with ſwords and bucklers with two Geſaes. Concerning them alſo Virgil writeth thus: — <hi>Duo Quiſ<expan>

Seruius in his Comments vpon this place doth interprete them, <hi>Haſtas viriles,</hi> manlike ſpeares: and addeth moreouer that valiant ſouldiers were woont to bee called in the French tongue <hi>Geſi.</hi> But it ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be written with <hi>ae</hi> the dipthong, <hi>Gaeſa:</hi> (of which you may ſee what we haue deliuered in the old mappe of Spaine, or M. Clarencieux Camden his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia, where hee hath learnedly handled this argument, and for this word, amongſt the reſt, ſhall ſatisfie thee to thy fill.) From hence, it may bee, it is that a kind of people there were named <hi>Gaeſati,</hi> becauſe they did weare and vſe theſe Geſes. Touching which I haue written more at large in my Theſaurus. The foreſaid authour affirmeth that their horſemen be better than their footmen: and that theſe horſemen did vſe to come to the field with many carts and great car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. Liuy alſo and Pomponius Mela do deliuer that they skirmiſh in chariots and waggons. The ſame likewiſe doth Strabo affirme of them, but that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth theſe waggons, <hi>Eſſeda,</hi> which is all one. Out of theſe charriots (ſaith Diodorus) they firſt throw a dart at their enemy comming againſt them: then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forſaking their chariots they fight on foot with their ſwords. I do vnderſtand out of Vegetius that in skirmiſhes they did vſe to fight in troupes and ſeuerall bands containing in number ſix thouſand armed men apiece. <hi>Cateruas,</hi> he calleth them: Of which word, as alſo of <hi>Eſſedum,</hi> ſee M. Camdens Britannia. They were naked all aboue the nauill, ſaue only that they couered their bodies, although very meanly god woot, with a long target, which was not broad inough for the largeneſſe of their bodies, as Liuy and Polybius do teſtifie. Likewiſe Gauls were <hi>Scutis protecti corpora longis:</hi> ſhielded their bodies with long targets, as Virgil reporteth. Theſe targets being about the heigth of a man in length, were, as euery man thought fit, adorned with certaine formes and pictures of liuing creatures, emboſſed and ſomewhat bearing out higher than the ſurface of the target it ſelfe, as Diodorus writeth: who addeth in another place that they defended or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their heads with a braſen helmet higher then ordinary, wherein were ingrauen either hornes or portraitures of birds or beaſts. The ſame authour witneſſeth that they vſed trumpets in their warres. Their ſwords ſaith Polybius, were heauy; and very long, as Liuie writeth, and without points, as Strabo telleth vs: made onely for this purpoſe, that they might wound the enemie with downe-right blowes: whereupon Virgil, (as Seruius noteth) writeth, <hi>Altè conſurgit in enſem,</hi> that is, he lifteth vp his ſword on high to giue the greater blow: with which if they did hit, they cut off the heads of their foes at one ſtroke. Yet notwithſtanding theſe ſwords were made without art and of a ſoft kind of iron, as Polyaenus affirmeth in his eigth booke. Wherefore of theſe ſame weapons thus gathereth Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das out of Polybius. They are ſo made that at the firſt onſet they giue one blow, and then preſently are ſo crooked and bended both in length and breadth, that vnleſſe you grant them ſpace immediately to retire and to ſtrengthen them with their feet, the next ſtroke can do no hurt. Diodorus termeth them <hi>Spathae,</hi> and ſaith that they hang by a braſen chaine on the right ſide. Neuertheleſſe Iulius Pollux commendeth this French ſword, calling it by the Greeke name <hi>(machaera.)</hi> Polybius, Strabo and Diodorus do teach that they wore about their neckes gold chaines, (which gaue occaſion to Virgil to ſay —<hi>Lactea colla Auro innectuntur</hi>—. Their lilly white neckes adorn'd with gold.) and about their armes and hands, coſtly bracelets: and thoſe amongſt them that were in place and authority, did weare garments died and garded with gold, (<hi>Atque aurea veſtis,</hi> golden garments the French did weare, ſaith Virgil.) They did adorne, ſaith Pliny, and ſet out their ſwords, ſhields, and head-peeces with corall. Some of them alſo ſaith Diodore, gilded their iron breaſt-plates. When they go to battell there is among them ſuch ſinging, howling, ſhowting, dancing, ſuch noiſe of targets, which they ſhake after their countrie faſhion and the fearefull clattering of armour ſo great, that all places round about did ſeeme to ring therewith, as Polybius and Liuy do iointly teſtifie. Strabo alſo and Diodorus affirme, that they did fight againſt the enemie with dogs. Moreouer they carried with them to the wars (if we may beleeue Poſſidonius in Athenaeus) paraſites, whom they would haue to ſing ſongs in their honour and commendation: and indeed the ſame thing is auouched by Diodorus. If they haue got the vpper hand of their enemies in battell, they are woont to ſacrifice their captiues vnto their Gods, as Athenaeus, vpon the teſtimonie of Soſipater verilie thinketh. When they returne from battell, (heere what Strabo reporteth of them) they hang the heads of their enemies vpon the manes of their horſes and ſet them vp vpon the towne gates, to be viewed and ſeene of of all men. But the heads of Noblemen, (heare Diodorus) embalmed with ſpices, they lay vp in caſes with the greateſt care that may bee; ſhewing them to ſtrangers, and will not part with them, either to their parents or to any other their friends, for any money. Liuy writeth, that they did offer vp in triumph, the ſpoiles of dead bodies, and the head being cut off from the body, in their temple, which is held in greateſt reuerence amongſt them. Afterward, the head being cleanſed, as their maner is, they gild the skull, and that they eſteeme for an holy veſſell, wherein they drinke at ſolemne feaſts and ſacrifices. And this is the cup of the Prieſts and rulers of the temple. Whereupon Silius writeth thus: <hi>At Celtae vacui capitis circumdare Sueti Oſſa (nefas) auro &amp; menſis ea pocula ſeruant.</hi> But this vile cuſtome do the Celtes obſerue The heads from carcaſe of their foes to pull: Which ſet in gold moſt curiouſly they carue, And in ſteed of cuppes doe quaffe in dead mens ſcull. Of the ordering of their Horſe battell which they call <hi>Trimarciſia,</hi> read Pauſanias in his Phocica. Likewiſe of their <hi>Silodunes,</hi> as Athenaeus, or <hi>Soldures,</hi> (ſouldiers) as Caeſar termeth them, reade theſe aforenamed authours, and, if you pleaſe, ad vnto them thoſe things which Leo the Emperour hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his eighteenth booke <hi>De Bellico apparatu,</hi> in the eighty and eight ſection. Now it remaineth that we ſpeake ſomething alſo of their common maner of liuing. Throughout all Gallia, (ſaith Caeſar) there be but two ſorts of men, that are made account of, and had in any great eſtimation; the one are the <hi>Druides,</hi> the other are their <hi>Knights.</hi> Theſe knights (of the Druides we haue ſpoken at large in our mappe of Gallia deſcribed by Caeſar) when need is and when any warre chanceth, giue themſelues altogether to feats of armes. And among them, as any man is of greateſt birth and ability, ſo hath he about him more ſeruants and retainers. The Druides are occupied about holy things: they haue the charge of publike and priuate ſacrifices; and do interpret and diſcuſſe matters of religion &amp;c. For the communalty is kept vnder in maner like ſlaues: and the noble men may lawfully deale with them in all points as with their ſlaues. They do not ſuffer their ſons to come in their preſence openly, vntill ſuch time as being men growen, they be able to ſupply the roomes of ſouldiers: and they count it a ſhame, that the ſonne as long as he is a boy, ſhould be ſeene abroad in his fathers company. Looke how much money the men do receiue with their wiues in name of their dowry, they make an eſtimate of their owne goods and lay ſo much in valew thereunto: all the which is occupied together in one ſtocke, and the increaſe thereof is reſerued, and which of them ſoeuer ouerliueth other, the ſtocke with the encreaſe of the former yeares falleth to the ſuruiuer. The men haue ouer their wiues, like as ouer their children, authority of life and death, &amp;c. Thus much wee haue collected out of the ſixth booke of Caeſars commentaries, where thou maiſt reade of many other things to this purpoſe, well worth the obſeruation. Diodorus Siculus affirmeth that their women are very goodly perſonages, and for bigneſſe of bone and ſtrength, little inferiour to the men: they are very fruitfull and good nources, or, as Strabo reporteth very good breeders and bringers vp of children. They, as Plutarch in the eigth booke of his Sympoſion, writeth, did vſually bring, when they went to the bath to waſh themſelues, together with their children and little ones, the skillet and pappe wherewith they vſed to feed them. A notable example of their worth and valour, thou ſhalt find in his booke of vertues, where hee ſheweth that it grew into a cuſtome amongſt them, that both for matters at home in time of peace, and abroad in time of warre, they vſed the counſell and aduiſe of their wiues, and whatſoeuer was done it was partly done by their appointment. Polyaenus alſo in his ſeuenth booke reporteth the very ſame thing of them. Notwithſtanding that their women are moſt beautifull, yet, as Athenaeus and Diodorus do both affirme, they are much giuen to buggery and to loue boies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all meaſure. But whether this be true or not I cannot tell. I would rather beleeue that it was not generally affirmed of all the Gauls; but rather ſpecially of thoſe which did inhabite that part of the countrey which was called Gallia Braccata, where the Maſſilyans, a people deſcended from the Greekes, did dwell, whoſe wantonneſſe, and effeminate maners, thoſe adagies or prouerbes cited by Suidas, <hi>Maſſiliam venis,</hi> and <hi>Maſſiliam nauiges</hi> do manifeſtly reproue for this fault. Hither alſo I do referre that which I haue read in the ninth booke of Clemens his Recognitions, ſpoken as I ſuppoſe vpon this very ſame occaſion: There was an ancient law or cuſtome among the Gauls, ſaith he, which did ordaine that to a new married man boies ſhould be giuen openly and in the ſight of all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which was accounted no maner of ſhame or diſhoneſty amongſt them. And I verily thinke that Strabo ſpake of this their vſage, in theſe his words: It was held for no maner of vnſeemely thing amongſt them, if they did commit buggery with yong men of one or two and twenty yeares old. Of the Celtae alſo this ſaying of Stobaeus is not to be omitted: where he writeth, that it was a more hainous crime &amp; offence amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ſeuerely puniſhed, if one did kil a ſtranger, than if one ſhould kill one of his owne countrey men: for this was but baniſhment, the other was death. But was not this thinke you a law only againſt ſuch mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as were committed in via Heraclea? Their apparrell they did ordinarily weare, as Strabo teſtifieth, was a kind of caſſocke ſomewhat like the Spaniſh cloake (<hi>Saga</hi> it is called of the Latines) of which Virgil in theſe words maketh mention, <hi>virgatis lucent ſagulis:</hi> Trimme they ſhine in ſtrip'd rugs: They were wouen of a courſe kind of wooll, and were called in their language <hi>Laenae,</hi> (yet the iudicious Caſaubone in his learned commentaries vpon this place of Strabo, thinketh that the place is corrupt, and that we ought rather to reade <hi>Chlenas,</hi> than <hi>Laenas</hi>) They did alſo weare breeches, (<hi>braccae,</hi> they call them) ſet out and bumbaſted, or looſe, as Lucane ſaith.

<pb facs="tcp:23194:270"/> ſelfe ſame forme and faſhion and is called in our language a <hi>Pallatrocke;</hi> for <hi>Rocke</hi> with the Flemings, is aſmuch as <hi>Veſtis</hi> in Latine, a weed, or veſture. Ariſtotle in the ſeuenth booke of his Politickes, in my iudgement, ſpeaketh of this kind of garment, when he ſaith that the Gauls did weare a kind of ſhort gabbardine. The forenamed Martiall doth ſpeake of a kind of weed vſed amongſt the Gauls which he calleth <hi>Bardocucullus Santonicus,</hi> The hooded cloake of Xantoigne. But Pliny beſide theſe, maketh mention of another kind of veſture vſuall amongſt them, in theſe his words: Wooll of it ſelfe, driuen together and wrought in maner of a felt, doth make a knid of cloath: and if in the making of it, you do worke it with vineger, it will be ſo ſtiffe and ſolide that you ſhall not be able to pierce it with the ſtroake of a ſword: this I thinke was firſt inuented by the Frenchmen. The ſame authour reporteth that theſe people did firſt make that cloth that is damasked with ſcutcheons or loze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge-work. In Iſidorus, out of Plautus theſe words are cited, <hi>Linnae cooperta eſt textrino Gallia.</hi> For the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of which I refer to the author himſelf, for the copies of Iſidorus are here very corrupt. Diodorus Siculus ſaith that they did vſe to weare rings vpon their fingers: yet Pliny reporteth that they wore them only vpon the middle finger. Caeſar teſtifieth that they tooke pleaſure in oxen, and ſuch kind of labouring beaſts. Now in like maner we will ſpeake ſomewhat of their diet and maner of liuing. They vſed in their ſeruices earthen veſſels, very thicke and ſtrong, and goodlily ſet out with flowres. At ſupper they generally all of them ſit, not vpon ſtooles, but on the ground vpon woolues skinnes or dogges skinnes ſpread vpon the ſame. Strabo ſaith that at their meat they ſit vpon beds or pallades lying vpon the ground. They are ſerued at their tables with little boies. Hard by them is the fire, where the pots with boiled meats hang ſee thing, and ſpits full of roaſt meat are continually going, as Diodorus reporteth. Their meats for the moſt part are porke and bacon; yea and ſometime they eate anie other kind of fleſh whatſoeuer, and that oft times is dreſſed with milke, as Strabo hath left recorded. But Athenaeus words, which hee citeth out of Poſidonius, are worth the noting: The Celtae make their drinkings vpon tables of wood, with a little hay ſtrowed vnderneath; theſe tables be not very high from the ground. They haue bread, (which, as Pliny writeth, they make light with leauen) but of it they haue no great quantity: their meat is a great deale of fleſh ſodde in water, broiled vpon the coales, or roaſt vpon ſpits. This, when it is brought to the boord, they take vp whole in both their hands, and like rauening lions doe teare it with their teeth: but if there be any of it ſo tough that they cannot eaſily gnaw it, that they cut in ſmaller pieces with a little knife. Their bankets they vſe to furniſh with all kind of fiſh, both freſh-fiſh, ſea-fiſh, and ſhel-fiſh, whatſoeuer kind, I meane, that either the freſh riuers, or brackiſh ſeas do affoord. Theſe they broile and dreſſe with ſalt, vineger and cummin ſeed, which things alſo they vſe to put into their pots. If many do meet at one table together, they ſit round in maner of a circle. The beſt man alwaies ſitteth in the middeſt: him I terme the beſt man, that either for martiall proweſſe, nobility, or wealth doth excell the reſt. The ſeruitoures, skinkers, or ſuch as do waite at the boord, do carrie drinke to the table in pots like pitchers, either of potters mettall, or elſe of cleane ſiluer. Of the ſame mettall are their diſhes and platters, in which they ſerue in their meat. Yet ſome of them haue them of braſſe: other ſome in ſteed of platters do vſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skets, made of twigs or oſiers. The wealthier ſort do drinke wine brought from Italy, or from the country neere about Marſeilles, and that for the moſt part is of the pure grape, yet ſometime they allay it or brew it with a little water: <hi>dercoma,</hi> they call it. They ſuppe it vp by a little and little out of the ſame cuppe, being euery foot ſipping and bibbing. A boy carrieth about the pot in both his hands. But Pliny teſtifieth that they made a kind of drink, of ſteeped corne, ſo ſtrong that it would make a man drunke. Diodorus Siculus writeth that they had a kind of drinke, which they call <hi>Zythum,</hi> (we now cal it <hi>Ale,</hi> the Britans as Dioſcorides teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth called it <hi>Curmi,</hi> or <hi>Curw</hi> as now the Welchmen pronounce the word.) Item the ſame authour ſaith that they made another kind of drink of the water wherein they had waſhed or ſod hony combes, (this now we call <hi>Mead:</hi>) yea and Ammianus Marcellinus ſaith that they did make and inuent euery day many new kinds of drinke in deſpite of wine, to counterfet it ſo neere as they could. I reade alſo in Diodorus Siculus that they did vſe to eate mans fleſh. But whether is this to be vnderſtood of their enemies fleſh only, and of ſuch as they ouercome in battell? For that they did thus at the field fought at Thermopylae, Pauſanias doth flatly affirme. Or, whether do you thinke that he ſo ſpake of them in regard that they ſacrificed men vnto their gods? For this was done, as Pliny reporteth, in ſuch ſort, that it was ſomwhat like as if they had gnawen them. Notwithſtanding in Sextus Rufus we reade of the Scordiſci Galli, that they vſed to drinke mans bloud, out of the skuls of their enemies which they had conquered in the field. Moreouer Diodorus writeth that they vſed to bid ſtrangers &amp; trauellers to their tables, &amp; after ſupper or dinner then to ask what they are, wherfore they come, whence they are, and whether they will. They vſed alſo when they had filled their bellies, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into talk vpon any argument as occaſion ſhould offer it ſelf, to fal out, and ſo to riſe and challenge one another into the fields, no whit reſpecting their liues or limmes: and that in this manner, as Poſidonius in Athenaeus reporteth: They being armed, ſaith he, challenge one another to fight aloofe, claſhing onely the points of their ſwords, neuer comming neere there by the length of their weapons, as if they were afraid to hurt one another: yet notwithſtanding ſometime it falleth out that one of them is hurt; and then except the ſtanders by doe part them, and keepe them a ſunder, they will not giue ouer till it hath coſt one of them his life: whereupon peraduenture Horace ſaid, <hi>Non pauentis funera Galliae,</hi> And deſperate France that fear'th no death. In old time alſo it was an ancient cuſtome amongſt them, that when the quarters and ioints of mutton were ſet vpon the table, the ſtrongeſt and talleſt man of them would take the legge, which if ſo be any other would challenge as due to him, and would offer to take it out of his hand, it muſt coſt one of them his life. Others do take vp in the theater gold, or ſiluer, or a certaine number of hogges-heads of wine: and aſſoone as they haue bound themſelues with an oath that they will endure that, for which they had receiued theſe gifts: then taking them, and diſtributing them vnto their moſt inward and deareſt friends, they ſtretch themſelues out ſtraight vpon their backes, and lay them downe vpon their ſhields, one ſtanding by that is to ſtabbe them in their throat and cut off their necke with a ſword. They lie downe to ſleepe on graſſe or ruſhes ſtrowed vpon the ground, as Polybius teſtifieth: or vpon deares skinnes, as Diodorus recordeth. In the thirteenth booke of Athenaeus, where you ſhall find theſe words, in my iudgement, ſpoken of Braccata Gallia, (They lie vpon skins betweene two Ganimedes:) For I am verily perſwaded, and I thinke all wiſe men with me, that he meant the Grecians of Marſeilles, and not the true and ancient Gauls whoſe maner it was, as before we haue noted out of Iulian the Emperour, that they vſed that act only for the procreation of children. Their houſes and habitations, ſaith Caeſar, for the moſt part were in woods, or vpon the bankes of brookes and riuers, thereby to ſhelter themſelues from the violence of the Sunne, and heat of Sommer: and thoſe, Vitruuius writeth, were made and couered ouer with oken ſhingles, or elſe with ſtraw. Strabo affirmeth that they are built in a maner round, of planks and hardles, couered with a great roofe, made taper-wiſe or ſugar loafe faſhion: this roofe, as Pliny writeth, was of ſtubble. Their gates, if we may beleeue Nicolaus in Stobaeus, did continually ſtand open. Iulianus the Emperour, in his Miſopogonus, relateth a tale, whereby we gather that they had the vſe of hot-houſes or ſtoues, ſuch as ſtill to this day are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſome places of this countrie. Villages they haue, as Polybius noteth, without any wals or rampart for defence againſt the aſſault of the enemies: For Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus reporteth that they learned of them of Marſeilles, to encloſe their townes with wals and ramparts. The maner of building and faſhion of which wals thou maiſt vnderſtand out of the ſeuenth booke of Caeſars commentaries: where moreouer thou ſhalt find this that followeth: when any great or notable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falleth out they giue notice of it through the fields and countries by lowd cries or proclamations one vnto another, and ſo ſtill forwards, like vnto our hue and cries, vntill it ſtay at the outmoſt border of the kingdome. Ammianus in his fiue and twentieth booke ſaith that they gaue themſelues much to ſwimming. In hunting, as I gather out of Cornelius Celſus, they were woont to ſtrike the deere with a venomed arrow. Item Aulus Gellius out of Pliny citeth theſe words of the ſame argument: The Gauls when they went on hunting, were woont to dippe their arrow heads in the iuice of hellebore, verily beleeuing that the fleſh of ſuch deere as were ſtroken and killed with them, was farre more tender than otherwiſe it would be: but by reaſon of the venome of the hellebore, they ſay they did vſe to cut off round about, a great deale of the fleſh where the arrow went in. Item Pliny alſo maketh mention of the hearb <hi>limeum,</hi> wherewith they made a kind of ointment, which they call <hi>venenum ceruarium,</hi> Hart-poiſon, with which in hunting they do beſmeare their arrowes. Ariſtotle in his <hi>Admiranda,</hi> ſheweth that amongſt the Celtae there is a kind of poiſon found, called by them <hi>Toxicum,</hi> (the Latine interpreter did read <hi>Xenicum,</hi> that is, ſtrange) which infecteth and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſo ſpeedily, that the hunters of that country when they haue ſtricken a deere with an arrow dipped in the iuice of this herb, they runne with all ſpeed, and do preſently cut out all that fleſh neere round about where the arrow went in, leſt the venome ſpreading it ſelfe further and further, the whole deere ſhould putrifie and ſo be marred and good for nothing &amp;c. Pliny maketh me beleeue that this confection or poiſon was made of the yeugh-tree (<hi>taxus,</hi> they call it) where hee ſaith that thoſe poiſons, which we now call <hi>toxica,</hi> wherewith they did beſmere their arrowes, were ſometimes called <hi>taxica.</hi> Of the poiſon and venemous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the yeugh-tree, we haue entreated before. But there was a tree which grew amongſt the Celtae much like vnto a figge-tree, whoſe fruit that it bare, was faſhioned like vnto the chapter of the Corinthiacke pillar. This fruit being cutte doth yeeld a iuice, wherein if any man ſhall dippe his arrowes, whatſoeuer hee ſhall ſtrike therewith, will preſently die of that wound, as Strabo affirmeth from the report of others. That the Gauls did not feare the danger of Earth-quakes, Ariſtotle and Plutarch do plainlie teſtifie. But whether it be true or falſe, I dare not affirme. Another notable example (except one ſhould thinke it to be a feined and forged tale) of great boldneſſe or rather of deſperate raſhneſſe, I find in Aelianus his <hi>varia hiſtoria,</hi> which is thus: They do account it, ſaith he, ſo fowle and ſhamefull a thing to flie or runne away, that oft times they will make no haſt to get from vnder houſes that they ſee are ready to fall vpon their heads, nay they will hardly out of thoſe houſes that are on fire, ſo that many times they be burnt to aſhes in the flame. Many of them alſo will ſtand ſtill vntill the waues and tide of the ſea do runne quite ouer them. Moreouer ſome of them will caſt themſelues into the ſea in their armour, and with their ſwords drawne, and ſhaking of their ſpeares, daren the tide, as if they could either fraie or wound the ſame. Let the credulous Iew beleeue this, if he will, I beleeue neuer a word of it, although I know that Stobaeus, and before him Nicolaus, did verily beleeue it all to be true. Heere I do by experience find, that ſaying of Pliny to be very true, that There is hardly any greater diſparagement to the truth, than when a falſe told is told by a graue authour. But may not one thinke, that I may requite one tale with another, that this was that ſight, which Lucian in his Apologia writeth, that his friend Sabinus went as farre as the Weſt ocean to ſee? Their funerals according to their maner and ſtate are very gorgeous and coſtly: all things that the dead men in their life time did eſpecially loue and affect, yea euen ſuch liuing creatures as they beſt eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, were caſt into the fire and burnt: and not long ſince, within the memory of our forefathers, euen their ſeruants and followers, whom they loued extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily well, when all ceremonies of the funerall were done, were caſt into the fire and burnt together with their Maſters or Miſtreſſes; thus Caeſar reporteth of them. To this Pomponius Mela addeth, That with the dead they burne and burie in the ground all things that they commonly vſed when they were aliue: their accoumpts and debts were deferred till doomes day. Some there were of them which would willingly caſt themſelues into the fires and graues of their friends, verily perſwading themſelues that they ſhould ſtill liue together with them: Item Diodorus Siculus reporteth, that ſome of them would caſt into the fire where their friends deceaſed were burnt to aſhes, their letters, verily beleeuing that they would reade them there: For that opinion of Pythagoras, of the immortality of the ſoule, had taken footing and deepe root amongſt them: being perſwaded that afterward, the bodies being dead, in proceſſe of time they ſhould againe returne into other bodies. Liſten alſo what Valerius Maximus ſaith of this matter: It was an ancient cuſtome ſaith he, amongſt the Gauls, as old records do verifie, vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to lend money in this world, to be paid againe in the world to come. Which the forenamed authour termeth <hi>Philoſophiam foeneratoriam,</hi> A couetous or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerly kind of Philoſophie, practiſed then by ſome vſurers. But can you tell where now a man may borrow an hundred pounds, vpon good ſecurity, till that day? I doubt whether there be any pale-faced cut-throat vſurer, glorious ſmooth-tongued gold-ſmith, crafty mocke-lawyer Scriuener, or any rag-merchant broker, in this our city, that was euer Pythagoras ſcholler. This Iewiſh ſect are all, I thinke by their practiſe, of the opinion of the Sadduces, who thought and taught that there was no reſurrection of the ſoule to be expected after this life. It is no wonder or ſtrange matter to thinke that the Gauls were of this opinion, if ſo bee that be true, that one Alexander in Clemens Alexandrinus doth tell of, namely, that Pythagoras did trauell into France. Tertullian out of Nicander doth write that they vſed to he abroad all night vpon the graues and tombes of valiant men: and there to expect the anſweare of ſome of oracle. I care not an halfe penny for that opinion of the great Orateur Tully, in that his oration which he made for Marcus Fonteius, where he writeth that The Gauls are hardly addicted to follow any religion at all: For Liuy, although in other things he be partiall and dealeth hardly with this nation, yet he plainly affirmeth that they be not very backeward in religion: And Caeſar, in his ſeuenth booke of the warres of France, who throughly well knew this people, ſaith, that they were much giuen to religion, and ſeruice of ſome god or other. Item he ſaith, That they did eſpecially worſhip god Mercury, of whom there were amongſt them many images and ſtatues, they affirming him to be the authour and inuentour of all arts and ſciences: him alſo they hold to be their guide and leader in all iourneies and waies through which they are to trauell: him they ſuppoſed to haue a great power and ſtroke in all maner of trafficke and gainfull trade for money: to him they offered mans fleſh in ſacrifice, as Minutius Felix writeth. Beſides him they did alſo worſhip Apollo, Mars, Iupiter and Minerua. Of theſe their gods they held the very ſame opinion,
<pb facs="tcp:23194:270"/> that other nations of the world did: viz. That Apollo being praied vnto, did driue away all diſeaſes. Minerua firſt taught the grounds of all arts and occupations: Iupiter, did rule and moderate the motion of the heauens: Mars, was preſident and guardian of the warres: That the Celtae did honour Iupiter, whoſe image or ſtatue was a moſt goodly tall oake, Maximus Tyrius doth plainly teſtifie. Of Mercury heare what Pliny in the ſeuenth chapter of his fowre and thirtieth doth write: Zenodorus, ſaith he, in our time did in the city Clermont or Auvergne (<hi>Aruerniae,</hi> the ancients called it) make the greateſt and moſt gorgeous ſtatue that euer was made in the world: who there for tenne yeares together working vpon the ſtatue of Mercury, had for his hire H S. CCCC. that is, as ſome men reade it, fowre hundred thouſand ſeſtertioes; which do amount in our money to 3333. pounds, ſixe ſhill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngs and eight pence. Strabo doth teſtifie that Diana, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſian Goddeſſe, had a temple at Marſeils. Item, Polyaenus witneſſeth, that the French-greekes <hi>(Gallo-graeci)</hi> did worſhip Diana: which Plutarch, in his booke of the Fortitude of women, doth auouch to be true. But beſide this Diana, they worſhip another by them ſirnamed <hi>Arduenna,</hi> as is verified by an ancient inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in marble, of which we ſhall ſpeake more anone. This goddeſſe by all probability ſeemeth to haue beene worſhipped in the forreſt Arduenna. For although it be there written DEANAE ARDVENNAE, yet I thinke there is no man meanly ſeene and trauelled in ancient inſcriptions, that is ignorant that by it is meant <hi>Dianae Arduennae:</hi> For the ancient Romanes did oft times vſe <hi>I,</hi> for <hi>E,</hi> and contrariwiſe <hi>E,</hi> for <hi>I,</hi> as the learned can beare me witneſſe. And in honour of her was this forreſt Arduenna conſecrated and made holy, or rather as I thinke heere was ſome temple erected and dedicated to her ſeruice, built either by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Gauls, ſo deuout and religiouſly giuen, as before is ſhewed, or, if you like that better, by the Romanes themſelues, as in the greateſt and moſt renowmed foreſt or wood within the compaſſe of their whole Empire, a place moſt worthy and beſt beſeeming this goddeſſe. And what maruell I pray you? being, I ſay, a place moſt fit and conuenient for this goddeſſe Diana, to inhabite and make her abode in? For ſhe is called of all ancient heathen writers <hi>Venatrix, Nemoralis, Nemorum &amp; ſyluarum Dea, virgo &amp; cuſtos;</hi> The goddeſſe of hunting, the goddeſſe of the woods, chaſes and foreſts; and the maiden keeper of the ſame: Lactantius, Lucane and Minutius Felix do affirme that they had three gods which they in their language called <hi>Eſus,</hi> or <hi>Heſus, Teutates,</hi> and <hi>Taranus:</hi> But the learned, for the moſt part, by them do vnderſtand Mars, Mercury and Iupiter: See M. Camdens Britannia. In Auſonius there is mention made of a god of theirs which they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Belenus:</hi> whom Herodian, by the iudgement of the learned Iulius Scaliger, calleth <hi>Belis:</hi> And whether this be the ſame with <hi>Tibilenus,</hi> whereof Tertullian maketh mention, Petrus Pithaeus in his Aduerſaria doth moſt learnedly diſpute; and doth there interprete it to be the ſame that Apollo is to the Greekes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer <hi>Abellio</hi> was one of their gods, as the forenamed Scaliger, at the ſame place, out of an ancient inſcription, doth teach vs. The ſame authour alſo maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Onuana,</hi> a goddeſſe of theirs. Saint Auſten, in his bookes of the city of God, doth affirme that they had certaine vncleane ſpirits or diuels, called by them <hi>Dusij,</hi> in the catalogue and number of their gods. But whether they did worſhip the god <hi>Serapis,</hi> (the ſame peraduenture with Pluto) the aboue-mentioned P. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeus, out of certaine words, of the ſixteenth booke of Ammianus Marcellinus his hiſtory, doth in the third chapter of his Aduerſaria, at large and learnedly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe: to whom I referre thee for farther ſatisfaction. Out of Florus alſo we learne that they worſhipped <hi>Vulcane</hi> for a god: who writeth that they did promiſe to giue him the armour and weapons of the Romanes their enemies. Athenaeus ſaith that they turned their faces toward the right-hand when they did their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to their gods. Of this matter, Plinie in the ſecond chapter of his eight and twentieth booke, writeth thus: In worſhipping of the gods wee offer to kiſſe the right hand, and withall we wind and ſway about the whole body: which the Gauls did hold to be more religious, if it were done toward the left hand. To theſe they did offer in their ſacrifices, men and other things, but eſpecially vnto Mars, as Caeſar teſtifieth, who thus writeth of them: To him, (namely to Mars) when they haue fought any battell, for the moſt part they do bequeath thoſe things that they haue wonne in the field: thoſe beaſts and liuing creatures that they conquere and take they kill and offer them for ſacrifice: all other things whatſoeuer they bring into one place: In diuers cities, in certaine holy and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated places, you may ſee great heapes of theſe things: and you ſhall hardly euer find any man ſo backward in religion or ſo vngodly, that either will hide and conceale ſuch things as he hath gotten in the field, or that will dare to take away ought that hath beene once conſecrated and laid vp in thoſe ſacred and religious places: and if ſo be that any man be either ſo prophane, or hardly that dareth take ought away, he is to bee puniſhed, by their lawes, with moſt cruell tortures. Diodorus Siculus reporteth the very like of them, They doe keepe, in the chappels and temples of their gods, ſaith he, great ſtore of gold, which hath from time to time beene offered to them, lying ſcattering heere and therein euery corner: and yet no one man for his life, (ſuch is their great ſuperſtition) dareth bee ſo bold as to touch one piece of it. But Caeſar goeth on forward in the ſame diſcourſe: They, ſaith he, which are ſicke or much diſeaſed, and ſuch as are in any great danger, or are to follow the warres, for their ſacrifices do either kill and offer other men, or elſe doe vow hauing obtained their purpoſe to ſacrifice themſelues: and in theſe their ceremonies they doe vſe the aduiſe, direction and aſſiſtance of the Druides: And this they doe for this reaſon: namely, for that they doe verily beleeue that for the life of man preſerued, the immortall gods can no way be ſatisfied and pleaſed but with the life and bloud of man: And therdfore for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they haue certaine ſacrifices appointed to be publickly ſolemnized and done. Others haue certaine images of an huge and mighty bigneſſe: whoſe limmes and parts of the body, being made of oſiers wreathen and roddled one within another, they fill full of liue men; theſe images being ſet on fire, the men within them are ſmoothered and at length with them burnt and vtterly conſumed to aſhes. The death and puniſhment of ſuch as are apprehended for murther, or fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or any other odious crime, they thinke to be much more pleaſing to the gods, than the death and ſacrifice of other men: but when there do want a ſufficient number of ſuch wicked men to furniſh this tragedy, then honeſt guiltleſſe men muſt be forced to play a part, and to vndergoe that puniſhment that they neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. Thus farre Caeſar. The ſame almoſt, but much different in words, Strabo doth write of them: Some, ſaith hee, in their diuine ceremonies they ſhoot through with arrowes, or elſe doe hang them vp by the neckes till they be dead: and then making an huge coloſſus or ſtacke of hay, and ſticking vpright a long pole in the midſt of it, they burne altogether, ſheepe and all kind of beaſts and cattell, yea and reaſonable creatures, men and women. Item Diodorus Siculus writeth of this matter thus: Condemned men, which they keepe for the ſpace of fiue yeares together continually bound to a ſtake, at length together with other goods and cattels they ſacrifice and burne in an huge bonne-fire. Minutius Felix alſo doth teſtifie, that to their god Mercurie they did vſe to ſacrifice men. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian in Apologetico, ſaith, that <hi>Maior aetas, Mercurio proſecatur,</hi> The ancienter ſort are hewed in pieces and ſacrificed to Mercury. So, that, it had beene much better for the Gauls, as Plutarch in his booke of Superſtition, writeth, that they had neuer had any maner of knowledge of the gods at all, then to haue beleeued that they might no otherwiſe be pleaſed and ſatisfied, then with the liues and bloud of mortall men: and to thinke that this is the beſt and only ſolemne ſacrifice and oblation that euer was vſed by any. Solinus alſo plainly affirmeth that this kind of ſacrifice and deteſtable cuſtome, was no maner of worſhip and ſeruice pleaſing to the gods, but rather a great iniurie and wrong done to religion, much offending them. This cuſtome of killing of men, was not vſed only when they offered ſacrifices to their gods, but euen in their diuinations and ſorceries. For they tooke thoſe men that were appointed for the ſacrifice or ceremonies, and ſtriking them vpon the backe, by the panting of their bodies, they did geſſe and diuine of the euent of that action intended, as Strabo doth witneſſe of them. When they do deliberate or conſult of any great matter, they do obſerue, ſaith Diodorus, a woonderfull and ſtrange kind of cuſtome and ceremonious ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For going about to kill and ſacrifice a man they ſtrike him vpon the midriffe with a ſword. But without the aduice and preſence of one of their Druides, they may not offer any maner of ſacrifice at all. And although that theſe butcherings and maſſacres of men were forbidden by Tiberius Caeſar, as Pliny teſtifieth, yet Euſebius in his fourth booke de Praepar. Euang. doth greatly lament that they were ſtill practiſed in his time, who liued, as all men know, in the daies of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine the Great. It is recorded by Pliny, that theſe people did vſe, in their ſorceries, coniurations and anſwering to demands in maner of propheſying, the hearb verueine. And thus much of the three Galliaes in generall. Of which thou maiſt reade many other things in Caeſar, Liuy, Ammianus, Strabo, Diodorus, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius and Athenaeus. Something alſo might haue beene ſaid of euery part particularly, if ſo bee that the ſmalneſſe of this ſheet, had beene capable of ſo large a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe: as alſo much might haue beene ſaid of Gallia Narbonenſis, the fourth part, which was a prouince of the Romanes, much differing from the other three in nature of ſoile, temperature of the aire, and quality of the inhabitants and people; which was, as Pomponius Mela writeth, better manured, inhabited, and more fertile, and therefore was alſo a farre more pleaſant and goodly countrie than any of the reſt. But of this we haue ſpoken in another place, apart by it ſeſfe. Behold the inſcription, which we ſpake of before, and promiſed to acquaint thee withall. DIS. MANIBVS. Q. CAESIVS. Q. F. CLAVD. ATTILIANVS. SACERDOS. DEANAE. ARDVINNAE. FECIT. SIBI. ET. SVIS. HAERED. IN FR. P. XII. IN AGR. P. XV. IIII. ID. OCTOB. IMP. CAES. FLAVIO. DOMITIANO. VIII. ET. C. VALERIO. MESSALINO. COS. This marble ſtone was found with this inſcription in the highway called Decia Salaria, by a place called the Seuen Bathes, <hi>(Septem Balneae)</hi> and from thence conueighed to Marcilianum, as Iulius Iacobonius, in his Adioinder to the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of Baptiſt Fontey written of the ancient family and ſtocke of the Gaeſij, citeth out of P. Ligorius. DIANA ARDOINNA alſo is mentioned in a certaine old inſcription, in that worthy worke of Smetius, which he hath written and intituled <hi>De Inſcriptionibus antiquis,</hi> in the eighth number of the two and twentieth leafe. Of other inſcriptions, coines, ſtatues, &amp; ſuch like monuments of the Gauls, or ſuch as any way may illuſtrate the hiſtory of this country, if thou beeſt deſirous of further inſtruction, we do counſell thee to haue recourſe vnto the ſaid Smetius, Fuluius Vrſinus, and others that haue of purpoſe written of that argument.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O I intitle this Mappe: For it is merely <hi>Caeſars,</hi> that is, portraitured and drawen only by that which he hath layd downe in his Commentaries: we haue not added one word or any one place out of any other author: neither haue we, to our knowledge, omitted any place there mentioned by him: Thus much I thought good to aduertiſe thee of, gentle Reader, leſt in vaine thou ſhouldeſt in this Map ſeeke for thoſe things which other ancient writers haue written of <hi>Gallia.</hi> Of the nature of the country &amp; people there inhabiting, I will not in like maner, which otherwiſe I vſe to do, adde to theſe any one word out of any other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: becauſe euery one that liſteth may do this out of <hi>Caeſar</hi> alone, which is an authour very common, and to be found ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in euery ſcholars ſtudy. For why ſhould I do this out of others, when as the Map is only framed out of him? But in ſted of this I thinke it not amiſſe here to compoſe this diſcourſe following of the <hi>Druides,</hi> ſelected out of all ancient hiſtorians.</p>

               <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his ſixth booke of the warres of <hi>France</hi> hath left recorded, that in <hi>France</hi> there were two ſorts of men which were in eſtimation and credit aboue the common ſort: One of theſe, ſayth he, were the <hi>DRVIDES,</hi> the other were the <hi>KNIGHTS, (Equites.) Strabo</hi> nameth theſe three, the <hi>Bardi, Vates</hi> (Prophets) and <hi>Druides:</hi> like as <hi>Lucane</hi> doth in theſe verſes, <hi>Laudibus in longum VATES dimittitis aeuum: Plurima ſecuri fudiſtis carmina BARDI: Et vos Barbaricos ritus morém<expan>

Of barbarous rites in things diuine you holy <hi>Druides</hi> write &amp;c. <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> affirmeth the ſame, but that thoſe which <hi>Lucane</hi> calleth <hi>Vates,</hi> he nameth <hi>Eubages. Diodorus Siculus</hi> maketh mention of the <hi>Bardi</hi> &amp; <hi>Druides</hi> only; but the latter ſort he calleth <hi>Saronides,</hi> by another &amp; diuers name, yet of the ſame ſenſe and ſignification. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſeemeth often times to terme them generally by one name <hi>Magi. Lucianus</hi> in <hi>Hercules Ogmios</hi> calleth them <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> So much of the name: now ſomewhat of the perſons themſelues. The <hi>KNIGHTS, (equites)</hi> ſayth <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when need requireth, and any occaſion of warre falleth out, do all go to warfare: and euery one of them, as he is of greater birth or reuenues, ſo he hath a greater retinue and number of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants attendant vpon him. Other honour and dignity than this they know none. The <hi>BARDI</hi> are Poets, as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> ioyntly teſtifie, and did vſually ſing ſongs and hymnes made in the commendations of famous and worthy men. They are muſicall Poets, which do ſing to the harpe or other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of muſicke, ſongs to the praiſe and commendations of ſome, and to the diſpraiſe and diſgrace of others. <hi>Feſtus Pompeius</hi> alſo affirmeth that theſe men did vſually ſing ballads made in commendations of the valiant acts of worthy men; and withall he ſaith that <hi>Bardus,</hi> in the Gauls language, ſignifieth a Singer. <hi>Marcellinus</hi> of theſe Poets ſpeaketh on this maner: The <hi>Bardi</hi> did vſe to ſing to the harpe, in very ſweet &amp; pleaſant tunes, ſongs compoſed in heroicall verſe, of the valiant acts of martiall men. In <hi>Strabo</hi> I obſerue that theſe are called <hi>Vates,</hi> (Prophets) and did vſe to offer ſacrifice, and to ſtudy naturall philoſophy. <hi>Ammianus</hi> (who termeth them <hi>Eubages</hi>) writeth thus of them: Theſe men ſearched deeply into the ſecrets of Nature, and laboured to lay them open and plaine. The learned <hi>Petrus Pithoeus</hi> thinketh that all theſe words, <hi>Bardi, Vates, Eubages, Semnothei,</hi> and <hi>Saronides,</hi> are but ſynonymes of the <hi>Drui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> And for that I ſee whatſoeuer of diuers writers are attributed to all theſe ſeuerally, doe agree to that one of the Druides only, (as is very apparent by that which followeth) I am eaſily drawen to be of his opinion.</p>

But omitting theſe opinions, let vs heare what</hi> Caeſar <hi>himſelfe ſpeaketh of this his</hi> Belgium. <hi>Hee in his 5. booke, where he ſpeaketh of the diſtributing of the Legions in</hi> Belgia, <hi>hath theſe words:</hi> Of the which one he committed to <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> the Legate, to be led againſt the <hi>Morini:</hi> another to <hi>Quintus Cicero,</hi> againſt the <hi>Neruij:</hi> the third to <hi>Titus Roſcius,</hi> againſt the <hi>Eſſui:</hi> the fourth he commanded to winter, with <hi>Titus Labienus,</hi> in <hi>Rhemes,</hi> in the confines of <hi>Triers:</hi> three he placed in <hi>Belgium:</hi> ouer theſe he ſet as commanders <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> the Treaſurer, and <hi>Lucius Munatius Plancus,</hi> and <hi>Caius Trebonius</hi> the Legates: one legion, which he had taken vp hard beyond the <hi>Po,</hi> with fiue cohorts, he ſent againſt the Eburones. <hi>And a little aboue in the ſame booke, where he ſpeaketh of</hi> Britannia, <hi>you ſhall find theſe wordes:</hi> The ſea coaſt (of <hi>Britaine</hi> he meaneth) is inhabited of thoſe which by reaſon of pillage and warre, went from <hi>Belgium</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: all which for the moſt part are called by the names of thoſe cities where they were bred and borne. <hi>Heere firſt it appeareth very plainly that</hi> Caeſar <hi>vnder the name of</hi> Belgium <hi>comprehendeth not only one city, but many: then, that he vnderſtandeth not by it all</hi> Gallia Belgica: <hi>ſeeing that he nameth the</hi> Morini, Neruij, Eſſui, Rheni, <hi>and</hi> Eburones, <hi>all which nations, he himſelfe and other good writers, do aſcribe to</hi> Gallia Belgicae. <hi>Therefore it is more cleare than the noone day that</hi> Belgium <hi>is a part of</hi> Belgica: <hi>but what part it ſhould be that is not ſo cleare. That it is not about</hi> Bauacum <hi>(Bauais) <hi>in</hi>
               </hi> Henault, <hi>as</hi> Leodius <hi>would haue it, it is manifeſt in that, that this is ſituate amongſt the</hi> Neruij, <hi>which</hi> Caeſar <hi>himſelfe doth exclude out of</hi> Belgium. <hi>Neither can I be perſwaded that it was neere the</hi> Bellouaci, <hi>but rather that it was that part of</hi> Belgica, <hi>which is more neere the ſea, and lieth vp higher toward the North: namely, where about the three great riuers the</hi> Rhein; Maeſe <hi>and</hi> Scheldt <hi>do meet and fall into the maine ocean: theſe do affoord an eaſie paſſage and fall into the ſea and from thence a ſhort cut into</hi> Britaine. <hi>Moreouer it is more likely that they ſhould paſſe the ſea, which were acquainted and vſed to it, and were ſeated vpon this ſhore and bankes of theſe riuers, then thoſe which dwelt vp higher into the country, to whom the ſea was more fearefull and terrible. They therefore that went from</hi> Belgium, <hi>into</hi> Brittaine, <hi>did only change coaſt for coaſt.</hi>

               <hi>Of the originall and reaſon of the word</hi> Belgium <hi>and</hi> Belgica, <hi>the opinions of ſundrie writers are diuers. Some there are which deriue it of <hi>Belgen</hi> or <hi>Welgen,</hi> a word of our owne, which ſignifieth a</hi> ſtranger. <hi>Another man of great learning and iudgement fetcheth it from <hi>Belgen</hi> or <hi>Balgen,</hi> ſignifying</hi> to be angrie, to fight. <hi>Our Chronicles do thinke it ſo named of</hi> Belgis, <hi>the chiefe city of this prouince. Neither do they agree in the placing and ſeating of it: for one of them placeth it at</hi> Bauais, <hi>a towne in</hi> Henault: <hi>the other at <hi>Veltſick</hi> a village about</hi> Oudenard. <hi>They which thinke it ſo named of the city</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis <hi>(which notwithſtanding is no where elſe read of in any good authour, either Geographer or Hiſtorian) they haue</hi> Iſidore, <hi>in the 4. chapter of the 13. booke of his</hi> Origines, <hi>for their patrone, where he thus ſpeaketh:</hi> Belgis is a city of Gallia, whereof Gallica the prouince tooke the name. <hi>The ſame hath</hi> Heſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius, <hi>the Grecian before him, in his Lexicon:</hi>

            <p>Caeſar, <hi>in his 1. booke of the warres of</hi> France, <hi>thus ſpeaketh:</hi> All <hi>GALLIA</hi> is diuided into <hi>3.</hi> parts: of the which the <hi>Belgae</hi> do inhabite one: the <hi>Aquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> another: the third, thoſe which in their language are called <hi>Celtae,</hi> but in the Latine <hi>Galli: Againe, within a few lines after:</hi> Of all theſe the <hi>Belgae</hi> are moſt ſtout and hardy: becauſe that being further off from the quaint behauiour and maners of the prouince: and for that they haue no trafficke with merchants, or ſuch as do bring in thoſe things which effeminate mens mindes: againe becauſe they are next neighbours to the Germanes, which dwell beyond the <hi>Rhein:</hi> with whom they make warre continually. <hi>Item, in the ſame page he thus deſcribeth the ſituation of their country:</hi> The <hi>Belgae</hi> do dwell in the skirts of <hi>Gallia:</hi> they do belong to that part which is within the riuer <hi>Rhein:</hi> they are vpon the North and Eaſt ſides of it. <hi>The ſame authour in his 2. booke hath theſe words:</hi> Caeſar found that many of the <hi>Belgae</hi> came from the Germanes, which long ſince paſſed ouer the <hi>Rhein</hi> and ſeated themſelues there by reaſon of the great fertility of the place: and that they had driuen out the Gauls, which formerly had dwelled there: and that theſe were the onely men, which in the daies of our fathers, all <hi>Gallia</hi> being ſore troubled, kept the Teutones and Cimbres from entering within the liſts of their territories: whereupon it came to paſſe, that the memoriall and record of theſe their famous acts haue made them to take much vpon them, and to be highly conceited of their great ſtomacks and skill in martiall affaires. <hi>Suet. in Tib. 9.</hi> In the German war he ſent ouer <hi>40000.</hi> voluntaries into <hi>Gallia. Again in the 8. booke of Caeſ. Com.</hi> The <hi>Belgae,</hi> whoſe valour was great. <hi>Strabo in the 4. booke of his Geography ſaith:</hi> The <hi>Belgae</hi> weare caſſockes or cloakes, their haire long, and ſide breeches about their loines. In ſteed of coates or ierkins they vſe a kind of ſleeued garmert ſlit, hanging down to their twiſt, or as low as their buttockes. Their wooll is very courſe and rough, yet is it cut off cloſe to the skinne: of that they weaue their courſe thick caſſocks, which they call <hi>laenas,</hi> rugges or mantles. Their weapons accordingly, are long ſwords hanging down along by their right ſide, a long target, lances anſwerable, and a iauelin (<hi>meris</hi> or <hi>materis,</hi> as ſome read) a kind of ſhort pike with a barbed head: ſome vſe bowes and ſlinges: others haue a ſtaffe like a dart, which they do not cast with a loop or thong, (as our Iriſh do) but with the hand only; yea and that further than one can well ſhoot an arrow: this they eſpecially vſe in hunting and fowling. They do all for the moſt part, euen to this day, vſe to lie vpon the ground; they dine and ſuppe ſitting in their beds. Their meat generally is made of milke and all kind of fleſh, eſpecially porke, both freſh and powdered. Their hogs do lie abroad in the fields night and day: theſe for bigneſſe, ſtrength and ſwiftneſſe of foot do ſurpaſſe thoſe of other countries; and if a man be not vſed to them they are as dangerous to meet withall as with a rauening woolfe. They build their houſes with boords, planks and hardles, couered ouer with a very great roofe. They haue ſo many and great herds of cattle and hogs, that they do not only ſerue <hi>Rome</hi> with thoſe fornamed caſſocks or rugs, powdered beefe and bacon, but alſo many other places of <hi>Italy.</hi> The moſt of their cities and commonwealths are gouerned by the Nobility and gentry: informer times the common people vſed yearely to chooſe one Prince, and one Generall captaine for the wars. They are for the moſt part ſubiect to the beheſts of the Romans. They haue a kind of cuſtome in their councels proper and peculiar to themſelues: for if any man do interrupt or trouble another by loud ſpeaking, or by making any tumult, the ſergeant commeth to him with a naked knife in his hand and threatneth him if he hold not his peace: this he doth the ſecond and third time: if then he will not be quiet, he cutteth off ſo much of his caſſocke, that the reſt may be good for nothing. This is a common thing to them with many other barbarous nations, that the ſeruices or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of men and women are ordered clean contrary to the cuſtomes &amp; maners which heere we vſe. <hi>Item, in another place.</hi> The Gauls the neerer they are to the North and to the Sea. ſo much the more hardy and valiant they are. They do eſpecially commend the <hi>Belgae,</hi> who are diuided into <hi>15.</hi> nations (in <hi>Caeſar!</hi> find <hi>31.</hi> mentioned) ſo that the <hi>Belgae</hi> alone ſuſteined the aſſault of the Germans, Cimbers and Teutones.

               </gap>. Tacitus reporteth that the word <hi>GERMANIA</hi> had not beene long vſed, and to be but lately heard of. The ſame authour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that this name was inuented by themſelues. Wherefore I do more eaſily aſſent to them, which deriue the originall of this word from the etymon of the countrey it ſelfe, than from the Latines. For it is much more likely that a nation ſhould impoſe a name vpon it ſelfe deriued from that language which it vnderſtood, than from a forren and ſtrange tongue whereof it was altogether ignorant. I thinke therefore they erre which thinke this name to be made <hi>à germine,</hi> that is, of buds or yong ſprouts; by reaſon of the great fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie and plenty of all things here growing. Of this opinion are Feſtus and Iſidorus. Thoſe alſo which deriue the name from the Latine word <hi>germanus</hi> ſignifying a <hi>brother,</hi> as Strabo doth, as who would ſay, brethren to the Gauls or French men, from whom, as he ſayth, they little differ, in my conceit are as farre wide from the trueth.

And the ſame man in another place deriueth it of <hi>ger,</hi> which, ſaith he, amongst our anceſters ſignifieth <hi>warre:</hi> which I ſee alſo pleaſeth Iuſtus Lipſius beſt. I know that <hi>gerre</hi> (or rather <hi>guerre</hi>) in the latter French tongue ſignifieth <hi>warre;</hi> but whether it ſignifieth ſo in our ancient Germane tongue, I know not. I doe eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that this nation firſt wrote and named it ſelfe <hi>werman,</hi> of <hi>wer,</hi> with <hi>e</hi> long, a mere Germane word, which ſignifieth any weapon whereby we ſmite or offend our enemie. From hence <hi>weren</hi> ſignifieth to defend himſelfe againſt the enemie: and we call euery man fit to beare armes, <hi>weerman</hi> or <hi>weerbaerman,</hi> (that is, a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likeman.) Inſomuch that they all called themſelues <hi>wermanos,</hi> or, <hi>wermannos,</hi> that is, warlike men. And Ceſar and Tacitus, beſides others, are moſt ſufficient witneſſes, that this name doth altogether agree with the nature and diſpoſition of this nation. As alſo Dionyſius Afer, who ſurnameth theſe Martialiſts or warlike men <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But the cauſe is plaine why theſe do call and write themſelues <hi>Germanes;</hi> becauſe they, wanting the digamma or <hi>W,</hi> in ſtead of it haue ſubſtituted the <hi>G.</hi> which alſo we ſee elſwhere done of them in the like caſe: as, for Wilhelmus, they write Gulielmus; for Waltherus, Galtherus; for Walfridus, Galfridus, &amp;c. So alſo it is likely that for <hi>Walli,</hi> they wrote and pronounced <hi>Galli.</hi> For euen we Germanes, on this ſide Rhene, retaining the ancient language, doe yet name theſe <hi>Galli</hi> by no other name than <hi>Walen.</hi> The <hi>Galli</hi> alſo themſelues romanizing (the libertie and ancient tongue being loſt) doe vnto this very day imitate this change of letters. Theſe few words out of many are for an example: for they vſually both write and pronounce, <hi>vin</hi> for <hi>wijn, <hi>Gueſp</hi>
               </hi> for <hi>Weſp, <hi>Gand</hi>
               </hi> for <hi>Wandt, <hi>Guedde</hi>
               </hi> for <hi>Weedt,</hi> by which they meane Wine, a Waſp, a Gloue, and Woad. So alſo I finde in a manuſcript <hi>Guandali</hi> for <hi>Wandali.</hi> If any man ſhall obiect that Strabo, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius Afer, Ptolemaeus, and ſome other Graecians, who knew the digamma Aeolicum, that is, the <hi>W,</hi> haue notwithſtanding written it with a ſingle <hi>V,</hi> I anſwer, that this nation was knowen to theſe men in times paſt only vnder the name of Celtae, and that this word <hi>Germane</hi> was firſt vſed of Ceſar or the other Latines in their writings: from whom the Grecians, imitating this writing, haue tranſlated this word into their language. But if any man deſireth to reade more of the etymology and reaſon of the word <hi>Germanie,</hi> let him peruſe H. Iunius his Batauia in the one and twentieth chapter. There are ſome hiſtorians that doe verily beleeue that all the <hi>Germanes</hi> were in latter times called <hi>Alemanes,</hi> Vopiſcus ſo perſuading them in the life of Proculus. Yet it is manifeſt out of Aelius Spartianus (who repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that Antoninus Caracalla the Romane Emperour, both nations by him being ſubdued, tooke him the ſurname of them both, and was intituled both by the name of <hi>GERMANICVS</hi> and <hi>ALEMANNICVS</hi>) that theſe were two diuers nations. Moreouer, this ſame thing is to be ſeene in the marble inſcriptions of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Valens, Valentinian, and Gratian: as alſo in the titles of Iuſtinian the Emperour. Againe, Ammianus in his <hi>26</hi> booke writeth, that the Almanes brake thorow the borders of Germanie, whereby it is as clere as the noone day that they were diuers. But that was the name of one family or people, this of the whole ſtocke or nation. Notwithſtanding, although this Alemannie of Stephanus, Ammianus, and other writers of that age was accounted only a part of Germanie, namely of that which lieth about the riuer Aleman (commonly called <hi>Altmul</hi>) yet all men of other countries, ignorant of the Germane tongue, do vſe the word Alemanie for all Germanie, and by Alemanes, do meane all the Germanes. But the inhabitants at this day name themſelues <hi>Teutſchen, <hi>Tuiſiones:</hi>
               </hi> whether of god <hi>Tuiſius,</hi> ſonne of the earth, of whom Tacitus maketh mention, or of <hi>Tuiſco,</hi> Noë his ſonne, of whom Pſeudoberoſus ſpeaketh; I leaue to the iudgement of the learned reader, for to me it is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. And thus much of the name. Ouid writing to Liuia, doth grace it with a very heroicall ſurname and honourable titles, when he calleth it <hi>ORBEM GER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANVM, ORBEM NOVVM, &amp; ORBEM IGNOTVM: The Germane world, The new world,</hi> and <hi>The vnknowen world.</hi> Ptolemey ſurnameth it <hi>THE GREAT.</hi> Pliny in the third booke of his Epiſtles vnto his friend Macer, calleth it <hi>LATISSIMAM, A moſt wide and ſpacious countrey.</hi> Learne the forme of it out of Dionyſius and Priſcian his interpreter, or as ſome call him, Rhemnius, in his periegeſis in this verſe: <hi>Haec tergo ſimilis taurino dicirur eſſe:</hi> In forme, they ſay, it's ſomewhat like vnto a large buffe hide. (but falſly: for this is truly ſpoken of Spaine, as Arid. Papius, before me, hath well obſerued.) The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and limits of this countrey are diuers and ſundry wayes deſcribed, according to the diuerſitie and alteration of times. Plutarch in Marius, doth extend it from the Exterior or Outmoſt ſea, and the Northern parts, to the riſing of the Sunne neere the fenne Moeotis <hi>[Mar delle Zabbache]</hi> where it toucheth the Ponticke Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia. Pomponius Mela alſo, and Pſeudoberoſus, do confine it with Sarmatia Europoea. And Martian ſtretcheth it fron Hiſter <hi>[Donawe]</hi> to the Ocean, euen vp as high as the deſerts of Sarmatia: (But the word <hi>Armeniae</hi> is falſly read for <hi>Sarmatiae,</hi> that I may with Pintian, by the way correct this fault in this authour.) Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Apher alſo placeth the Germanes at the fenne Moeotis. Yea and P. Diacono in his firſt chapter, vnder the name of Germanie, comprehendeth alſo all Scandie or Scone in Denmarke, where he deſcribeth that denne or caue neere the Scricſinners, in which ſeuen men ſlept. And this I thinke to be that Exteriour Germanie which Euſebius in his ſixt booke <hi>De Praepar. Euang.</hi> deſcribeth toward the North. Iſidore therefore rightly placeth the Riphaean mountaines at the head of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Others haue made the ſea, the Alpes, Viſtula (the riuer <hi>Wixell</hi>) and the Rheine, to be the limits of the ſame. But Tacitus taketh from it whatſoeuer is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Donawe and the Alpes. For he confineth it within theſe limits: namely, the Rhene, Donawe, the Dacia's (<hi>Tranſſyluania</hi> and <hi>Walachia</hi>) and the Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's, <hi>(Ruſſia)</hi> with whom alſo Ptolemey the prince of Geographers conſenteth. But Strabo and Pomponius do notwithſtanding extend it euen to the very Alpes, and ſo by theſe mountaines do diuide it from Italy, as it were by a certeine naturall rampart or bulwarke. And this is yet at this day the true and naturall Germanie: which on the North ſide is circumſcribed with the ſea, on the South with the Alpes, on the Weſt with the Rhene, and on the Eaſt with Viſtula <hi>(Wixell)</hi> or Odera. Moreouer, Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dion do diuide this true Germanie into the <hi>VPPER</hi> and <hi>LOWER:</hi> they call that the <hi>VPPER GERMANIE</hi> which is neerer the fountaines or head of the Rhene; that the <hi>LOWER</hi> which reacheth from thence to the Ocean. But beyond the Rhene alſo, namely in <hi>Belgia,</hi> Ptolemey hath other two Germanies, to wit, a <hi>SVPERIOR</hi> and <hi>INFERIOR.</hi> To whom agreeth Marcellinus, who nameth this the <hi>SECOND,</hi> that the <hi>FIRST.</hi> But I do not iudge theſe to pertaine to the true Germanie: but that it was ſo improperly called of the Germanes, who, as Dion witneſſeth, afterward poſſeſſed it, and fixed their ſeats there. And firſt of the <hi>Tungri,</hi> who as Tacitus writeth, firſt of all other paſſed ouer the Rhene. Item we read in Ceſar of certaine <hi>Belgae,</hi> ſprung from the Germanes. Hence it is that he witneſſeth that the <hi>Neruij, Aduatici, Atrebates, Ambiani, Morini, Menapij, Caletes, Verocaſſes, Veromandui, Catuaci, Condruſi, Eburones, Caereſi, Paemani, Segni,</hi> were generally <hi>GERMANI TRANSRHENANI, the Germans beyond Rhene.</hi> Tacitus ſaith that the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giones, Triboci,</hi> and <hi>Nemetes</hi> were called Germanes. Suetonius recordeth that <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour placed fortie thouſand Germanes in France neere the banke of the Rhene. Eutropius writeth that there were of them foure hundred thouſand. Item by the teſtimony of Pliny we are made to beleeue that the Germane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did dwell euen as high as the riuer Scaldis <hi>(the Sceldt.)</hi> And that at this day the Germans are ſeated beyond Scaldis, vp as high as the ſtraits of the Ocean, the language which they vſe, doth manifeſtly proue. So that Dion in his <hi>53</hi> booke hath truely related, that they haue ſpread themſelues as farre as the Britiſh ocean, vp to the citie Bononia or <hi>Boloigne:</hi> which Zoſimus calleth a citie of Lower Germanie.</p>

            <p>Plutarch in <hi>6. Conuiual.</hi> writeth that they weare apparell only againſt froſt and colde of Winter. Pomponius writeth, that the men do couer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with barkes of trees. And the ſame man with Tacitus writeth, that they all vſe a caſſocke for a couering, faſtened together with a button or thorne, and that in their childhood they go naked, euen in the greateſt colde and dead of Winter. Neither is there any other habit for women than for men, but that the women oft times do couer themſelues with linnen garments. Pliny hath noted that they alſo ſowe flax, and that the women make cloth of it; neither do they know any finer garment than that: and that they mingle it with purple. Euery mother giueth ſucke to her owne childe, neither are they committed to bondmaids and nurſes. We learne out of Euſebius ſixth booke <hi>de Praeparat.</hi> and out of S. Clements ninth booke <hi>de Recog.</hi> that they giue not themſelues to childiſh things, or any thing which they thought to be vnprofitable, as namely, to ſtage-playes, painting, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke. Yet they haue giuen themſelues to making of verſes, but ſuch as are rude and ſimple, as witneſſeth the forenamed Iulian in the ſame <hi>Miſopogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos.</hi> And this is one kinde of memoriall or Chronicle with them, as Tacitus witneſſeth. Otherwiſe they ſpend their whole life in warlike and milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exerciſes. We reade in Caeſar, that robbery is not accounted as any infamy. And Seneca ſayth, they take care for nothing more than for armour and weapons. In theſe they are bred and borne, in theſe they are nouriſhed. If their countrey haue long peace, they do voluntarily go and offer their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to thoſe nations which do wage warre vpon any other, as Tacitus witneſſeth. They procure their mothers, children and wiues to bring vnto them being in fight, incouragements and meat and drinke, neither do they feare to ſucke and dreſſe their wounds. They begin the skirmiſh with ſinging, ſound or claſhing of their weapons, and dancings. They animate and encourage one another with ſhouting and loud hallowings. In battell they vſe long ſpeares and pikes, the weapons of the Alemans or <hi>Teutones,</hi> as Lucan in his ſixth booke affirmeth. To leaue his armour behinde him in the field was accounted the greateſt diſgrace that might be, inſomuch that many after their returne home from the warre, haue ended that infamie with an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Hence perhaps is that of Euſebius and S. Clement, which report, that many of the Germans do hang themſelues. Dion and Herodotus ſay that they vſually ſwimme ouer riuers: for the lightneſſe of their armour and the talneſſe of their bodies doth lift them vp, and beare them aboue the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as Tacitus witneſſeth. Pliny teacheth that the pirats do ſaile in ſeuerall hollow trees, whereof ſome one doth beare thirtie men apiece. The ſame man ſayth that there is yet a cuſtome with them, that the conquered giue an herbe to the conquerours. Appianus Alexandrinus ſayth they contemne death, by reaſon that they are perſwaded that they ſhall returne to life againe. Perhaps for that cauſe peraduenture it is, that Tacitus ſpeaketh thus of them: They deſire no great funerals: that only is obſerued, that the bodies of famous and better ſort of men may be burnt with ſome certeine kinde of wood. They heape vpon the fire neither garments nor any ſweet ſauours. Euery mans armour, and ſome mans horſe alſo was caſt into the fire. The ſepulchre is raiſed with turfs, &amp;c. They haue alſo a certaine kinde of puniſhment only vſed here, as Tacitus ſayth, who writeth, that they hang traitours and runnagates vpon trees, but idle and luſtie fellowes (Lipſius readeth, big-limmed and lazie lubbers) they throw into puddles and fennes, caſting an hardle or grate ouer them. (Caeſar in his ſixt booke <hi>de bello Gall.</hi> makes me imbrace that reading of Lipſius, where, if I be not deceiued, he maketh them ſlothfull, whom they account in the number of runnawayes, cowards and traitours: neither do I ſee how theſe differ; to accuſe a man for idleneſſe, and to make him infamous for ſlothfull dulneſſe.) This is that diuerſitie of puniſhment, according to the diuerſity of offences. They vſe not any ſacrifices: and they count them only in the number of gods (if we may beleeue Caeſar) whom they ſee, as the Sunne, the Moone, and Vulcan. But afterwards, as it is manifeſt out of Tacitus, who liued vnder Verna the Emperour, they got themſelues other gods alſo, as Mercury, Hercules, (whom, if we may credit Lucian, they did call <hi>Ogmion</hi>) Mars, Iſis, and the mother of the gods; beſide one named Alcis. The ſame Tacitus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that they accounted alſo Velleda and Aurinia amongst the number of their gods. Suidas mentioneth this, but that he readeth <hi>Beleda</hi> for <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leda.</hi> Theodoſius out of Dion writeth, that the virgin <hi>Ganna</hi> gaue out oracles. He alſo heere maketh mention of the temple of <hi>Tanfannae.</hi> He ſayth that the <hi>Sueui</hi> (which is the greateſt nation of all Germany) did worſhip the mother Earth, which (as Lipſius readeth) they call <hi>Aërtha,</hi> which yet is called <hi>Aerde.</hi> But they haue no images. Tertullian in his <hi>Apolog.</hi> writeth (if the reading be vncorrupt) that <hi>Belenus</hi> is the god of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici. Plutarch, and out of him Clemens Alexandrinus, teacheth that they haue certaine holy women (Tacitus calleth them <hi>Agathias</hi> &amp; <hi>Polyaenus,</hi> Fortune-tellers, Propheteſſes) who did tell of things to come by the roaring, wirlings, and circumuolutions of riuers. It is very like that Caeſar meant theſe ſame people, which he reporteth ſayd to Ariouiſtus, that it was not lawfull for the Germans to ouercome, if they fought before the new moone. Hither are thoſe things to be referred which Strabo ſpeaketh of the Propheteſſes of the Cimbrians (people of Germanie) in his ſeuenth booke. Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the ſecond booke of his <hi>Var. hiſt.</hi> chap. <hi>31.</hi> hath noted that they foretell things to come, euen by birds, entrals of beasts, ſignes, and foreſpeakings. Tacitus is witneſſe, that they made experimentall diuinings, euen by the neying of their horſes. It is manifeſt out of Suetonius his Domitian, that they had alſo Diuiners, which foretell by looking into the entrals of beaſts. We reade in Tacitus, that at an appointed time they publikely ſacrificed thoſe men, and that in their conſecrated groues, and by calling on the names of their gods: which I alſo gather out of Claudian his firſt booke of the praiſe of Stilicon, who calleth theſe woods, cruell by reaſon of their ancient religion. Tacitus alſo attributeth vnto theſe a certaine kinde of caſting of lots. Ioſephus in his eighth booke of Antiq. chap. <hi>8.</hi> doth tell a prety tale worth the reading, of a captiue ſouldier, concerning their skill in diuination by birds. And thus of many things we haue ſelected theſe few particulars of Olde Germany, which hath now a new face, farre other faſhions, rites and maners than at that time it had. Caeſar will affoord more to the greedy Reader, but eſpecially Tacitus in his peculiar booke written of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Moreouer, ſome things thou mayeſt finde in a Panegyricke ſpeech made to Aurelius Maximianus the Emperour. The Epitome of Liuie in the <hi>104.</hi> booke, witneſſeth that he wrote of the ſituation and maners of Germanie. Caecilius reporteth, that Plinius Secundus his vncle wrote twentie books of the warres of Germanie. Agathias witneſſeth that Aſinius Quadratus did moſt curiouſly deſcribe the eſtate of Germanie. But we hitherto
<pb facs="tcp:23194:279"/> want all theſe books of Pliny and Liuy. Notwithſtanding there are ſome men of no reputation, which bragge that they haue thoſe bookes extant by them, and do ſuffer them to lie hid and fight with wormes to the great iniurie and dammage to learnings common-wealth. Of this vanquiſhed, and yet inuincible Germanie, theſe men tooke their names or ſurnames, to wit, Nero, Claudius, Druſus, (of whom Ouid thus ſpeaketh, <hi>Et mortem &amp; nomen Druſo Germania fecit:</hi> Great Druſus was of Germane named, and there he li'th intomb'd.) Germanicus Caeſar this mans ſonne, Tiberius Caeſar, C. Caeſar, Nero, Vitellius, and Domitian; as Suetonius, Dion, Tacitus, and their coines do witneſſe. Item, Nerua, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Traian, M. Aurelius Antoninus, Commodus, Carocalla, Maximinus, Maximus his ſonne, Gallienus, and Claudius; as their ancient coines doe plainly teach. Aurelian alſo, Maximilian, Valentinian, Valens and Gratian, as ancient ſtones and inſcriptions do teſtifie. Laſtly, Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus and Euſebius in his ninth booke <hi>de Hiſtor. Eccleſ.</hi> do auouch the ſame. Inſomuch that the moſt learned Iuſtus Lipſius hath rightly obſerued and noted vpon the firſt booke of Tacitus Annals, that almoſt all the Emperours ſince Tiberius haue taken their ſurnames from this moſt warlike na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I haue a piece of braſſe money in which is the picture of M. Aurel. Antoninus, with this inſcription: <hi>M. ANTONINVS AVG. TR. P. XXV.</hi> on the backe ſide is a firre tree, neere which ſtandeth <hi>Victorie,</hi> with a ſhield in which is written <hi>VIC GER.</hi> and about the verge or skirt, <hi>IMP. VI. COSS. III.</hi> It is no maruell that Germanie ſhould be ſignified, by the firre tree, for it is very common and familiar to this region: and Pliny deſcribeth the beſt of them all to be in the Alps; in that part or ſide as I coniecture which looketh toward Germany. For we haue obſerued that few or none do grow, ſcarſe in any tract of the Alps, on that ſide toward Italie. And this is that Germanie, with which the Romane nation waged war from the yeere ſix hundred and fortie after the building of Rome, Caecilius Metallus and Papirius Carbo being Conſuls, euen vnto the yeere one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand one hundred and ſixtie foure: at what time it was taken of the Goths, a people of Germanie, in the reigne of Honorius the Emperour. So long was this Germanie winning, that I may ſo ſpeake with Tacitus, who doth freely confeſſe, that it was rather triumphantly conquered, than baſely van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. That the diſpoſition of the countrey might the better be vnderſtood, I thinke it not amiſſe to adde theſe few hiſtories to the former. Of the <hi>SIMPLICITY</hi> of theſe people, out of Suetonius <hi>de Claudio.</hi> He being moued with the ſimplicitie and affiance of the Germans ſuffered their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to ſit in chiefe roomes of the Theatre, for that being brought into the places where the comminaltie and common ſort vſed to ſit, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Parthians and Armenians to ſit amongst the Senatours, they boldly on their owne accord ſtepped to thoſe higher places, affirming that their valour and eondition was nothing inferiour to theirs. Here alſo Tacitus in his 13. Annal. ſpeaking of the Friſian Germans, and being gone to Rome, while they wait and attend Nero's leaſure, who was buſied about other matters, among thoſe things which are vſually ſhewed to Barbarians, they come to Pompies theatre, to ſee the great multitude of the people there aſſembled. There ſitting idle (for they were delighted with playes like fooles) inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about the ſitting in the liſts, differences of ſtates, demanding which is the gentleman, which is the Senatour, they obſerued ſome in ſtrange appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell in the ſeats of the Senatours: and asking who they ſhould be, they vnderſtood, that that honour was giuen to the ambaſſadours of thoſe nations which did excell in vertue and friendſhip with the Romans, they cried out aloud, <hi>NO MORTALL MEN MAY BE PREFERRED BEFORE THE GERMANS FOR VALOVR AND FIDELITIE:</hi> they ſtep aſide, leaue their ſeats, and place themſelues among the Senatours: which was well taken of all the beholders: being held for a token of their ancient ſpirit and courageous ſtomacke. Nero made them free of the citie of Rome. Of their <hi>SECVRITIE, ex Arria. 1. Alexand.</hi> Alexander asked the Celtae (or Germans) what thing all the world moſt feared? thinking that the greatneſſe of his power and name had pierced as farre as the Celtae, yea and farre beyond them, that they would haue anſwered, that they feared him aboue all men in the world beſide. But the Celtae anſwered him farre otherwiſe than he expected: to wit, that they feared leſt heauen ſhould fall vpon them, becauſe they liued farre from Alexander, and dwelt in places hard to come to, and that they ſaw him make expedition another way. Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander calling them friends and entertaining them into the number of his friends and confederates, ſent them home againe, adding this one thing, That the Celtae are proud and arrogant fellowes. Of their <hi>CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OVVNE STRENGTH, ex Caeſar. Comment. lib. 4.</hi> The Germans ſayd that they did neither firſt beginne warre with the Romans, neither do they refuſe to anſwer them, if they be prouoked, and to meet them where they will aſſigne; becauſe this is a cuſtome of the Germans continued from their anceſtours, to anſwer him whoſoeuer ſhall proclaime war againſt them, and neuer to offer conditions of peace vnto their enemies. Yet to ſay this, that they came vnwillingly thither, being that they were caſt out of houſe and home: if the Romans deſired their friendſhip and amity, they might be able to ſtand them inſtead and do them good ſeruice: or els let them giue them lands, or at leaſtwiſe ſuffer them to hold thoſe which they haue gotten with their ſwords. They yeeld themſelues inferiour to none, but to the Sueui only, to whom they thinke the immortall gods are not equall: otherwiſe in earth, there is no nation whom they can not ouercome. Of their <hi>MAGNANIMITY ex L. Flor. lib. 3.</hi> What was the pride of Ariouiſtus king of the Germans? When the ambaſſadours ſayd, Come to Caeſar: he anſwered, But who is Caeſar? And if he will, let him come, ſayth he, himſelfe, what needeth he care how our Germanie doth? Doe I meddle with Romans? But theſe things of Ariouiſtus are more largely handled by Caeſar himſelfe, in his <hi>1.</hi> Comm. <hi>de Bel. Gall.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>Dion,</hi> an authour of good credit, and who ſometime, it is certaine, was Preſident of this country, I read that the <hi>PAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NONES</hi> were ſo named for that they vſed to were ſleeued coats made <hi>ex pannis,</hi> that is of patches or pieces of wollen cloth, cut and ſlaſhed after their manner and faſhion, not vſuall in other countries. That they were ſo named of the Apennine mountaines, <hi>Iſidore</hi> affirmeth he hath read in ſome one authour or other: but ſure I thinke he dreamed when he wrot this, ſo vnlike it is from the trueth. <hi>Ptolemey</hi> reſtraineth <hi>PANNONIA,</hi> their countrey, within the riuers <hi>Donaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and <hi>Saw,</hi> and the mountaines <hi>Cetius</hi> and <hi>Albanus,</hi> making, as ſeemeth, theſe to be the true and naturall bounds of the ſame. The ſame in effect doth <hi>Strabo,</hi> who extended the <hi>Pannonij</hi> Weſtward vp as far as the city <hi>Segeſtica, (Segeſd,</hi> the place, where it ſometime ſtood, is yet called, as <hi>Bonfinius</hi> writeth) Northward vp as high as the riuer <hi>Iſter</hi> or <hi>Donawe:</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Eaſtward as lowe as <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and the <hi>Sardiaei,</hi> a kinde of people dwelling betweene <hi>Moeſia, Dardania</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia. Florus</hi> writeth that theſe Pannones are entrenched and walled, as it were, within two great forreſts or wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and theſe three riuers, <hi>Dra, Saw,</hi> and <hi>Donaw. Dion</hi> ſaith, that they dwell and poſſeſſe all that tract of ground that is betweene <hi>Noricum, (Bauaria,</hi> or <hi>Bayern)</hi> and <hi>Moeſia Europaea, (Seruia</hi> and <hi>Boſna.) Appaianus</hi> maketh them to abut Weſtward vpon the Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des or Iapydes, a people of <hi>Illyria</hi> now called <hi>Craner,</hi> and Eaſtward vpon <hi>Dardania (Boſſen.)</hi> But in this he is deceiued, that he calleth theſe people <hi>Paeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi> a common errour among the Grecian hiſtorians, which <hi>Dion</hi> in his nine and fortieth booke did firſt diſcouer: For of the Romans, and of themſelues, they are called <hi>Pannonij.</hi> The <hi>Paeones</hi> are a nation diuers from theſe, lying betweene mount <hi>Rhodope</hi> and the marine coaſts of <hi>Macedonia. Ptolemey, Strabo, Dion, Aurelius Victor,</hi> and ancient inſcriptions do diuide <hi>Pannony</hi> into the <hi>HIGHER</hi> and <hi>LOVVER: Liber Notitiarum,</hi> The booke of Remembrances, into the <hi>FIRST</hi> and <hi>SECOND. Optatus Afer</hi> maketh <hi>three Pannonies:</hi> but vntruely, ſeeing that thoſe aboue named, approoued au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, doe deſcribe but two: and the coine of the Emperour <hi>Decius,</hi> this countriman borne, doth mention no more. <hi>Solinus</hi> writeth, that this country is very plaine and champion, and as rich and fertile a ſoile as any other thereabout. <hi>Appian</hi> ſaith, that it is full of woods, and that it hath no cities nor townes, only the lands and fields are diuided vnto certaine farmes and families. In <hi>Hygenus</hi> I reade that a price and cuſtome was impoſed vpon theſe lands accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fertility and goodneſſe of euery aker: for there were fields of the firſt and ſecond price; woods yeelding yearely great plentie of maste; woods of the meaneſt ſort of feed and paſtorage. &amp;c. But <hi>Iornandes</hi> certaine ages after reporteth otherwiſe of this his natiue country; and affirmeth it to be beautified with many goodly cities. The people doe liue and fare as hardly as any people vnder heauen, hauing neither good ground nor good aire, nor hauing of their owne growing either oile or wine, but very little and bad, neither doe they regard to plant and ſet theſe commodities, the greateſt part of the yeare being there very colde and bitter, nothing elſe almoſt but a continuall vnkinde Winter. <hi>Dion</hi> writeth, that they haue ſome Barley and Millet [<hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, Spelt <hi>(Zea)</hi> and Millet] of which they make their bread and drinke: and withall affirmeth that he writeth not this by heare-ſay or relation from others, but of his owne experience and knowledge as he learned and ſaw at ſuch time as he was Lieutenant there. Yet he ſaith they are a moſt ſtout and hardy people, but hauing nothing woorthy the name of honeſty and ciuility, being generally very haſty and bloudy minded, killing and ſlaying without any reſpect or feare of God or man, and that vpon euery croſſe word and light occaſion. <hi>Solinus</hi> auoucheth the ſame to be true, ſaying, that this country is very ſtrong and well furniſhed with couragious and ſtout men. <hi>Tibullus</hi> in his fourth booke, ſaith that they are a wily and crafty people. <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Paterculus</hi> called them, <hi>Feroces,</hi> fierce and cruell. But the ſame author doth againe aſmuch commend them, not only for their great loue of military diſcipline: but for their skill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Latine tongue, and for that diuers of them are learned and ſtudious of the liberall ſciences. <hi>Auſonius</hi> nameth them <hi>Armiferos,</hi> a warlike peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his tenth booke <hi>de Praeparat. Euangelica,</hi> giueth out that theſe people, eſpecially thoſe that dwelt about <hi>Noricum, (Bauaria,</hi> or <hi>Bayern)</hi> did firſt finde out the vſe of copper or braſſe. <hi>Herodian</hi> ſaith, that they are bigge bodied, very tall, ready to fight, and to kill and ſlay vpon euery occaſion: but of ſo dull a conceit and ſimple, that they doe not eaſily perceiue whether one deale or ſpeake ought craftily and ſubtilly, or meane well and plainly. The Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of <hi>Mamertinus</hi> nameth this <hi>Pannony</hi> the Empreſſe of all nations for valour, and, like as <hi>Italy,</hi> renowmed for ancient honour. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith that this countrey yeeldeth great plenty of mast or akornes. The ſame authour alſo, in his historie of Nature hath left recorded, as if it were a matter of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that heere the herbe <hi>ſaliunca,</hi> a kinde of lauender, doth naturally grow of it owne accord. <hi>Oppian</hi> commendeth the Pannonian dogges, which <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſianus</hi> in this verſe affirmeth to be good hunters: <hi>Nec tibi Pannonicae ſtirpis temnatur origo:</hi> The hounds heere bred are not the woorſt that ere I ſee. The Pannonian cappes made of beaſts skinnes or furres, ſuch as ſouldiours vſe to weare, <hi>Vegetius</hi> in his booke of warre doth highly commend. This country afterward <hi>Probus</hi> the Emperour permitted to haue vines, and by the helpe of the ſouldiers himſelfe did plant them in mount <hi>Almus (Arpatarro)</hi> neere <hi>Sermium (Sirmiſch)</hi> the place where he was borne, as alſo vpon mount <hi>Aureus (Meczek)</hi> in <hi>Moeſia ſuperior (Seruia)</hi> as <hi>Sextus Aurelius Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> in his life, doth teſtifie. In <hi>Paeonia,</hi> a prouince heere, abbuttant vpon mount <hi>Rhodope</hi> toward <hi>Macedony</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> the ſoile is rich and fertile of golde, that many men haue found lumps of golde-ore of more then a pound weight. And in the confines of this country <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Admiranda</hi> doth write, that oftentimes the earth or vpper ſoard being by continuall ſhowers waſhed away, that kinde of golde which they call <hi>apyrum,</hi> (quicke-golde, if I may ſo call it, ſuch as haue not touched the fire) is found without digging or any other labour. But heere againe I doe alſo obſerue an error very frequent amongst the Greeke writers, miſtaking <hi>Paeonia</hi> for <hi>Pannonia:</hi> For <hi>Pannonia</hi> or <hi>Hungary</hi> euen to this day is ſo rich of golde, that it is wonderfull and ſcarſe to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of ſuch as haue not ſeene it, as <hi>Bonfinius, Broderith,</hi> and <hi>Ranzan</hi> doe iointly affirme, who do all write that they haue ſeene very many golden twigges of vines, ſome as long as ones finger, others of halfe a foote long: but of the richneſſe of <hi>Paeonia</hi> for mines of golde, I haue neuer heard nor read in any authour to my remembrance. <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> in the life of <hi>Pyrrhus Elienſis</hi> hath noted, that the <hi>Paeones</hi> doe vſe to caſt the bodies of dead men into pondes or deepe pooles. <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> in his eight and thirtieth oration writeth, that the <hi>Paeones</hi> did worſhip the Sunne, and that the ſigne or idoll of the ſame, which they adored; was a little diſh, put vpon the end of along pole and ſet vpright. But whether this be meant of them, or of the <hi>Pannones</hi> (for that this authour is a Grecian) I know not, I leaue it to the conſideration of the learned. The like is that place of <hi>Aelianus</hi> in the twelfth chapter of his ſeuenth booke <hi>de Animalibus,</hi> where he writeth a diſcourſe of the laborious painfulneſſe of the women of this countrey, well worth the reading and obſeruation. <hi>Tzetzes</hi> alſo, in the three hundred and eighteenth chapter of his tenth Chiliade, nameth the <hi>Paeones</hi> for the <hi>Pannones,</hi> where he hath ſomething perteining to this our purpoſe. <hi>Antigonus</hi> in his booke <hi>de Mirabilibus,</hi> writeth that in <hi>Illyria</hi> and <hi>Pannonia</hi> is that kinde of beaſt which they call <hi>Monychos: Aelianus</hi> termeth it <hi>Monops:</hi> Others, <hi>Bonaſus. Diaconus</hi> in the eighth chapter of his ſecond booke of the hiſtorie of <hi>Lombardie</hi> writeth that <hi>Pannonia</hi> breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great plenty of Buffes or Bugles, <hi>(Biſontes)</hi> and that he heard of an honeſt old man, that fifteene men haue beene knowen to lie together vpon one buffe hide, noting thereby the huge greatneſſe of this beast. And thus much of both thoſe <hi>Pannonia's:</hi> now it remaineth that in like maner we ſay ſomething of <hi>Illyris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This country is called of <hi>Ptolemey ILLYRIS:</hi> of <hi>Stephanus ILLYRIA, ILLYRIAE</hi> and <hi>ILLYRIVM:</hi> of Hiſtorians and Geographers <hi>IL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LYRICVM. Valerius Maximus</hi> writeth, that one <hi>Alexander</hi> wrot a whole booke of the deſcription of this country. It was ſo called, if we may giue credit to <hi>Appianus Alexandrinus,</hi> of <hi>Illyrius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Polyphemus:</hi> or <hi>Cadmon,</hi> as <hi>Apollodorus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> doe thinke. The bounds of this prouince are by diuers diuerſly aſſigned. For <hi>Ptolemey</hi> confineth it with the Hadriaticke ſea, <hi>Iſtria,</hi> the two <hi>Pannonies,</hi> and mount <hi>Scardus, (Marinai,</hi> they now call it.) <hi>Pliny</hi> endeth it at the city <hi>Liſſus (Aleſio.) Pomponius</hi> maketh it to begin at <hi>Tergeſtum, (Trieſte,</hi> a city of <hi>Friuli,)</hi> and to end at the riuer <hi>Aea,</hi> which is neere <hi>Apollonia, (Siſſopoli,</hi> a towne of <hi>Macedony</hi> in <hi>Greece.) Martianus</hi> extendeth it yet further, namely euen vp as high as the Ceraunian mountaines, as in like manner <hi>Strabo</hi> doth. <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the life of <hi>Tiberius</hi> writeth thus of the bounds of this country; <hi>ILLYRICVM,</hi> which lieth betweene <hi>Italy,</hi> and the kingdome of <hi>Noricum; (Bayern) Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Macedony,</hi> the riuer <hi>Donawe</hi> and the gulfe of <hi>Venice.</hi> And <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> he maketh it yet more large, ſtretching it out in length from the head of the riuer <hi>Iſter, (Donawe</hi> euen vnto the Ponticke ſea, <hi>(Mar Maiore.) Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Rufus</hi> who liued in the time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Roman Emperour comprehendeth vnder the name of <hi>Illyricum</hi> theſe ſeuenteene prouinces: Thoſe two of the <hi>Norici,</hi> the two <hi>Pannonies, Valetia, Sauia, Dalmatia, Moeſia,</hi> the two <hi>Dacia's, Macedonia, Theſſalia, Achaia,</hi> the two <hi>Epiri, Praeualis</hi> and <hi>Creta.</hi> Thus much of the name and limits of this country out of diuers authours.</p>

            <p>We in this Mappe haue expreſſed only <hi>Ptolemey's Illyricum,</hi> which hee diuideth into two parts, namely into <hi>LIBVRNIA</hi> and <hi>DALMATIA, Liuy</hi> in his ſixe and fortieth booke, according to the people and inhabitants of the ſame, diuideth it into three parts: of the nature of which prouince <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth in this maner: All the ſea coast of <hi>Illyricum</hi> is well furniſhed with fit and commodious hauens: both the maine land, I meane, and the ilands neere adioyning to the ſame. The ſoile is very fertile of all maner of fruits and rich commodities, eſpecially of oliues and ſtrong wines. The countrey that is ſituate about this, is wholly mountainous, colde, and couered with ſnowe; ſo that vines are heere very rare, either in the high grounds or plaines and vallies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Propertius</hi> not altogether vnfitly called it <hi>Gelida Illyria,</hi> Bleak and frozen <hi>Illyria: Appian</hi> nameth the people <hi>Incolas bellicoſiſimos,</hi> a most warlike and couragious people. <hi>Liuy</hi> ſaith that they are a very hardy nation both by ſea and land: <hi>Florus</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> maketh them cruell and bloudy men, and much giuen to robbe and ſteale. <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperor in his diſcourſe <hi>de Caeſaribus,</hi> teſtifieth plainly that they are one of the ſtouteſt and valianteſt nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all <hi>Europe. Vegetius</hi> recordeth that there were alwaies reſident in <hi>Illyria</hi> two legions called <hi>Martiobarbuli:</hi> theſe <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian</hi> Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> named afterward <hi>Iouiani,</hi> and <hi>Herculei:</hi> and they were preferred before all other legions whatſoeuer. <hi>Illyricis ſudant equitatibus alae;</hi> as <hi>Claudian</hi> reporteth in the commendations of <hi>Serena. Lampridius</hi> maketh them well ſeene and renowmed for their skill in ſoothſaying, and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of euents to come, when he writeth, that <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> excelled this nation in that skill. <hi>Iſogonus</hi> in <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth that there be a kinde of men amongst theſe which doe bewitch with their eies, and doe kill ſuch as they doe beholde and looke vpon any long while together: eſpecially ſuch of them as haue firie eies, like thoſe which are moued with anger, and theſe kind of people haue two ſights in ech eye. <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſaith that they are great wine bibbers, and, as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> reporteth, very much giuen to drunkenneſſe. Of the maidens and wiues of this countrey ſee <hi>Varro</hi> in the ſixteenth chapter of his ſecond booke. <hi>Claudian</hi> in his ſecond panegyricke to <hi>Stilico</hi> ſignifieth that they were permitted about the raigne of the latter Emperours, to haue vines, where he thus writeth: <hi>Exectis inculta dabant quas ſecula ſyluis, Reſtituit terras, &amp; opacum vitibus Iſtrum Conſerit.</hi> Which was done, as ſeemeth, about the time of the Emperour <hi>Probus.</hi> In <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> I finde mention made of <hi>Sabaia,</hi> the drinke of the poorer ſort of people, which they made of barley or wheat turned into a liquour or kinde of woort. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in his firſt booke of his Stromaton, hath recorded that theſe people firſt found out that weapon which the Romans called <hi>Pelta,</hi> a kinde of ſhield or target. The kine heere euery yeare doe bring two or three calues a piece, and ſome foure; yea ſome fiue or more at once: and doe giue ſo much milke at a meale, that euery day one cowe yeeldeth more then a large gallon. Againe, the hennes doe not lay only once a day, but ſome two or three egges a peece euery day, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Admiranda</hi> plainly affirmeth. <hi>Aelianus</hi> writeth that he had heard by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from others, that their goats heere are whole footed, not clouen as in other places. <hi>Pliny</hi> recordeth that heere groweth the beſt <hi>Gentian,</hi> a kinde of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoort, or hearbe, whoſe root is of great vertue and requeſt in phyſicall vſes. The ſame authour commendeth the cockles of <hi>Illyria</hi> for their extraordinarie greatneſſe. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> teſtifieth that heere in the high countrey far from the ſea, groweth the beſt and goodlieſt Lychnis, or Roſe campaine. <hi>Ouid</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke <hi>de Arte Amandi,</hi> doth much commend the Illyrian pitch. <hi>Theophraſtus, Cornelius Celſus, Ouid,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius Vticenſis,</hi> doe mention the Illyrian flower-de-luce, an hearbe, beſide his beauty, of ſoueraigne vſe in Phyſicke: the beſt of which, and that which is of greateſt eſtimation, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, groweth in the wildes and woods about the riuers <hi>Drilo (Drino,</hi> or <hi>Lodrino)</hi> and <hi>Narona,</hi> now called <hi>Narcuta.</hi> In <hi>Illyria,</hi> if one may beleeue <hi>Feſtus,</hi> in the word <hi>Hippius,</hi> euery ninth yeare they were woont to throw foure horſes into the ſea, as a ſacrifice to <hi>Neptune,</hi> great commander of the ſame. <hi>Dionyſius Vticenſis</hi> and <hi>Caelius Apitius</hi> doe ſpeake of <hi>oleum Liburnicum,</hi> a kind of oile made heere. The ſame author telleth vs of a cold ſpring or well in <hi>Illyria,</hi> ouer which if a man ſhall ſpread any clothes they will burne, and at length be cleane conſumed. And thus much generally of <hi>Illyria:</hi> now it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that we ſpeake a word or two of <hi>Liburnia</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> the ſeuerall parts of the ſame: whoſe beginning and ending, as <hi>Florus</hi> thinketh, is at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Titius, (Cercha,</hi> or <hi>Poliſcha:)</hi> or at the city <hi>Scardona (Scardo)</hi> ſituate vpon the banke of that riuer, as <hi>Ptolemey, Dioſcorides, Galen</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> do thinke. <hi>Liburnia</hi> is renowmed for thoſe kinde of ſhippes which heere were firſt made and vſed, and therefore were named <hi>Naues Liburnicae:</hi> they ſeeme to haue beene like vnto our pinnaces or foiſts, light and ſwift of ſaile, and therefore were good for pirates and ſea-robbers: and <hi>Vegetius</hi> in his booke of warre writeth that they were held to be the beſt kinde of ſhippes for ſeruice and fight vpon the ſea, and therefore in warre to be preferred before any other kinde of ſhipping whatſoeuer: this alſo <hi>Appian</hi> doth confirme, who ſaith that for lightneſſe and ſwiftneſſe they did farre ſurpaſſe any other. And <hi>Zoſimus</hi> writeth that they were as quicke of ſaile as thoſe gallies that were forced and rowed with fifty oares: but in this he is deceiued, that he thinketh them to haue beene ſo named of a certaine city in <hi>Italy. Apitius</hi> telleth vs, as we ſaid before, of a Liburnian oile, vſed, as ſeemeth, about ſome ſeruices in the kitchin. Of the iron mines in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> ſee <hi>Caſſiodore</hi> in his third booke <hi>Variarum,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Symeon.</hi> Theſe verſes of <hi>Statius</hi> in his <hi>Siluae,</hi> doe ſhew that it hath alſo ſome veines of golde: <hi>Quando te dulci Latio remittent Dalmatae montes, Vbi Dite viſo Pallidus foſſor redit, eruto<expan>

The ſame authour in the ſame place writeth, that amongst the <hi>Ardiaei,</hi> a people of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> in the confines neere to the <hi>Autariatae,</hi> there is a great mountaine, and neere to that as great a valley, out of which water runneth in great abundance; yet not at all times, but in the ſpring time only: which in the day time they powre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a veſſell, and keepe it cloſe within the houſe, at night they ſet it abroad in the open aire vncouered: which being done for ſix daies together, at laſt it congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and becommeth as fine ſalt as may poſſibly be ſeene. <hi>Pliny</hi> in the skirts of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> placeth a caue which he calleth <hi>Senta,</hi> with a wide deepe mouth, into which if one ſhall caſt any thing though neuer ſo light, and in a day neuer ſo calme, preſently there riſeth a ſtorme like to a whirlewind. Hither peraduenture belongeth that fable of the two rocks of which <hi>Dionyſius Afer</hi> ſpeaketh. In the ſame countrey there is a hole called <hi>Diana's</hi> caue, in which, if one may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <hi>Phlegon Trallianus,</hi> there are many dead bodies, the ribbes of which are more then ſixteene eles long a piece. Giue him the whetſtone. Thus farre of this countrie and the people of the ſame, collected out of the moſt ancient authours that are extant and haue come to our hands. Latter writers haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this <hi>Illyria, SLAVONIA,</hi> and the people or inhabitants of the ſame, <hi>SLAVONES, Slauonians:</hi> by which name, being reclaimed from the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inciuility of other nations, and by holy baptiſme incorporated into the body of Chriſts Church, in the time of <hi>Baſilius</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Leo,</hi> who ſucceeded him in that Empire, they are deſcribed in the eighteenth chapter of that his booke <hi>de Bellico apparatu,</hi> where he thus ſetteth out their nature and manner of life: It is a populous nation, able to indure all maner of miſeries; heat, colde, raine, nakedneſſe, want of meat, drinke and other ſuch like neceſſary things, they can eaſily abide. They were woont to be humane &amp; courteous to ſtrangers: which hoſpitality they do very diligenly mainetaine and keepe euen to this day: for they alwaies vſed to ſhew themſelues gentle and kinde to trauellers and ſtrangers, to entertaine them friendly and courteouſly, and to goe with them and conduct them from place to place, to defend and keepe them ſafe and ſound from all hurt and danger. So that if a traueller were wronged by the negligence of his hoſt, they preſently made warre vpon him, as againſt a publike enemy. For they held it for a great argument of fidelity, if the wrong done to a ſtranger were righted or any kinde of way reuenged. Moreouer, this alſo doth ſhew them to be humaine, in that they do not binde their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to a perpetuall ſeruitude, but rather they detained and kept them with them as captiues, and preſcribed them a certaine ſet time of their ſeruitude, after which being expired, paying a certaine fine or peece of mony, they might if they pleaſed returne home to their owne countrie againe: or, if they thought good, ſtay ſtill amongſt them as frinds and freemen. Their women are ſaid to be very modeſt aboue thoſe of other countries: for many of them doe take the death of their huſbands ſo heauily, that they will die with them, and one way or other make an end of their liues with them: for they cannot abide to liue as widowes alone after their huſbands death, and to marry the ſecond time that is counted a foule ſhame. Their ordinary fare is millet: they are very temperate and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their diet. Other toiles of huſbandry they cannot away withall: for they loue to liue more freely and gentlemanlike: by no meanes they will be drawen with great labour and trauell to prepare great and ſumptuous banquets and dainties, and then when they haue done, to eat and drinke them vp. In warre they arme themſelues with two iauelings or darts a peece. Some of them alſo do cary great ſhields which they call <hi>Thyrei:</hi> for they do vſe wooden bowes and ſhafts, whoſe heads they dip in a very ſtrong poiſon: for whoſoeuer he be that is wounded, except he preſently drinke treacle or ſome other holſome &amp; ſoueraigne anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, or ſhall by and by cut off all the place which is wounded, that it run no further, the whole body will ſurely rot and periſh. They doe delight to flie to ſteepe and craggie places, not eaſily to be aſſaulted or come vnto, and there to abide and dwell. Thus far <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour.

They report, as <hi>Aelianus</hi> writeth, that there haue dwelt heere ſo many and ſundrie nations (more than in any other country of the world) by reaſon eſpecially, that all times and ſeaſons of the yeare are very mild and temperate: againe, for that the goodneſſe of the ſoile is excellent, well watered, and very fertile of all maner of fruites, and yeeldeth great ſtore of paſtorage: <hi>Item,</hi> becauſe it is croſſed with many riuers, and hath the ſea very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious lying round about it, and the ſea coaſt on all ſides open, and cut into ſundrie baies, inlets, creekes and hauens, ſeruing very fitly for the entertainment and harborough of goodly tall ſhippes.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He length of this country is bounded by two riuers; with <hi>Tiber</hi> on the Eaſt: and <hi>Macra (Magra)</hi> on the Weſt: on the South it hath the Tuſcane ſea (<hi>Mare Tuſcum,</hi> or <hi>Tyrrhenum;</hi> now <hi>mar Toſco</hi>) For although, as <hi>Liuy</hi> and <hi>Polybius</hi> do teſtifie, before the Romane Empire it was more large, and extended his bounds beyond the Appenine mountaines, euen as farre as <hi>Atria (Atri)</hi> whereof the Atreaticke ſea, (<hi>Hadriaticus ſinus,</hi> the bay of <hi>Hadria, Golfo di Venetia</hi>) tooke the name: yet afterward being expelled and driuen from thence by the Gauls, it was conteined within theſe bounds. Of thoſe eleuen prouinces into which all <hi>Italy</hi> was by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> diuided, as <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifieth, this was the ſeuenth. The <hi>Origines,</hi> a booke which commonly goeth vnder <hi>Catoes</hi> name, do diuide this countrie into the <hi>Maritima,</hi> (that part which coaſteth along the ſea, and is of <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> in the ſtory of <hi>Aurelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaid to be fertile and full of woods) the <hi>Tranſciminia,</hi> beyond the mount <hi>Ciminus (Monte viterbo)</hi> and the <hi>Lartheniana,</hi> ſo named of the city <hi>Larthenium. Iornandes</hi> and <hi>Ammianus</hi> in his 26. booke doth make mention of <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria Etruria,</hi> about the towne <hi>Piſtorium (Piſtoia.)</hi> Moreouer, <hi>Lib. de Limitib.</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Etruria Vrbicaria.</hi> Was not this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the city of <hi>Rome? Dionyſius Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> in his ſixth booke writeth that it was diuided into 12. Dukedomes: <hi>Liuy</hi> in his firſt booke calleth them people (<hi>populos</hi> hundreds, tribes) at which it ſeemeth <hi>Virgill</hi> did aime, where he thus writeth, <hi>Gens illi triplex populi ſubgente quaterni.</hi> Three Nations great <hi>Etruria</hi> do poſſeſſe, foure tribes ech nation it contein'd. Out of the which chuſing one king in common, ech people ſent their ſeuerall ſergeants, to attend vpon him. <hi>Seruius</hi> nameth them <hi>Lucumones,</hi> at the ſecond booke of <hi>Virgils Georgickes,</hi> and would haue the word to ſignifie kings: yet <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaith that they are men ſo called of their madneſſe, for that they make all places where they come vnluckie and vnfortunate. In the forenamed <hi>Origines,</hi> they are called twelue colonies; and are thus recited in order, <hi>Ianiculum, Arinianum</hi> vpon <hi>Tiber, Pheſulae,</hi> and another <hi>Arinianum</hi> vpon <hi>Arnus, Phregenae, Volce Volaterra, Cariara</hi> otherwiſe named <hi>Luna</hi> vpon the ſhore, <hi>Ogygianum, Aretium, Roſellae,</hi> and <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinium</hi> within the land. <hi>Volaterranus</hi> reckoneth them vp by theſe names and in this order: <hi>Luna, Piſae, Populonia, Volaterra, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyllina, Feſulae, Ruſſellana, Aretium, Peruſia, Cluſium, Faleria</hi> and <hi>Vulſinia.</hi> An ancient monument of ſtone, yet remaining at <hi>Vulſinium (Bolſena)</hi> as <hi>Onyphrius</hi> affirmeth, maketh mention of fifteen Hundreds of <hi>Etruria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The country hath been called by diuers names. For out of <hi>Pliny</hi> we learne that it was firſt named VMBRIA: who withall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that the <hi>Vmbri</hi> were throwen out of it by the <hi>Pelaſgi,</hi> and thereupon it was called PELASGIA. Theſe the <hi>Lydi</hi> did expell as the ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> with <hi>Trogus</hi> doth witneſſe, of whoſe king <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> it was intituled TYRRHENIA, as <hi>Paterculus, Halicarnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeus, Strabo</hi> and <hi>Liuy</hi> haue left recorded. Soone after that, of the ceremony of ſacrificing, it was called in the Greeke tongue TVSCIA. It was alſo named, as the ſame <hi>Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> writeth RASENA, of a certaine Duke or Generall of that nation: In <hi>Myrſilus,</hi> if I be not deceiued, it is corruptly written <hi>Raſenua.</hi> Moreouer it was called COMARA and SALEVMBRONE, if we will beleeue the feined <hi>Beroſus, Annius,</hi> and ſuch like fabulous writers. The <hi>Phocenſes,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Clio</hi> writeth, ſometime poſſeſſed it. The fragment of <hi>Antonius</hi> neere the lake <hi>Arnus</hi> maketh mention of the Phocenſes, and the lake Phocenſis. <hi>Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> alſo in his firſt booke ſaith that the <hi>Siculi</hi> did inhabite it before the entrance of the <hi>Pelaſgi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nature of the ſoile is very fertile of all maner of things, yea of vines eſpecially, as <hi>Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> hath giuen out. The large champion plaines, diuided into ſeuerall by-hils and mountaines, are well manured and very fruitfull, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. It is very woody, good paſtorage and well watered with many pleaſant ſtreames, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> iuſtifieth. <hi>Martianus</hi> ſaith that for fertility of ſoile it was euer renowmed and of great eſtimation: which fertility is no ſmall meanes to draw the people to giue themſelues ouermuch to pleaſure and eaſe: for they are, as the ſame <hi>Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> writeth, very fine in their apparell and dainty in their diet both at home and abroad: who indeed beſide things neceſſarie, do carrie about with them, euen when they go to warre, diuers fine things moſt curiouſlie wrought onlie for pleaſure and delight. <hi>Euſtathius</hi> calleth it a robbing, cruell and vnciuill nation. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his 2. booke <hi>de praeparati. Euang.</hi> ſaith that they were much giuen to Necromancie. <hi>Arnobius</hi> in his 7. booke <hi>contra Gentes,</hi> maketh it the mother and nurce of ſuperſtition. They were alwaies counted very religious, and ſo were the firſt that found out ſacrifices, diuinations, and ſoothſayings, from whom alſo the Romanes receiued theſe vaine and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious arts: as alſo the <hi>Sella curulis</hi> (coach of eſtate) <hi>paludamenta, trabea,</hi> (the rich robe) <hi>toga pretexta, toga picta, faſces, ſecures,</hi> (hatchets) <hi>litui, apparitores, curcules, annuli, annuli,</hi> (rings) muſick, &amp; the <hi>ludiones</hi> (whifflers.) Laſtly, all their orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of triumph &amp; robes of the Conſuls, or rather, (that I may vſe the words of <hi>Florus</hi>) all the brauery &amp; badges wherewith the honorable eſtate of the Empire was graced &amp; ſet out. <hi>Caſsiodore</hi> in the 15. ſection of his 7. book doth attribute to them the inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the caſting and working of ſtatues of braſſe. Heere hence it aroſe that the Romans firſt committed their children to the <hi>Etruſci,</hi> to be taught &amp; brought vp, as afterward they vſed to do to the Grecians, as you may read in <hi>Liuy, Strabo</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi> That the flute <hi>(tibia)</hi> was the inuention of the <hi>Tyrrheni,</hi> by which they did not only fight, but alſo whip their ſeruants, yea and to ſeeth, <hi>Iulius Pollux</hi> doth cite out of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Of them <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the 8. booke of his <hi>Conuiual.</hi> writeth, that by an ancient ſtatute they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to diſperſe their couerleds and blanckets when they roſe out of their beds in the morning. <hi>Item,</hi> taking of their pots off the fire, they left no print thereof in the aſhes, but did alwaies rake them abroad. They neuer would ſuffer any ſwallowes to come within their houſe. They might not go ouer a broome. They would keep none in their houſe that had crooked nailes vpon his fingers. Yet <hi>Thimon,</hi> in the 12. booke of <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> his <hi>deipnoſophiſton,</hi> calleth them voluptuous and licentious liuers, and none of the beſt report for their conuerſation: heereof you may ſee manie examples if you take anie delight in ſuch ſtories. The like you may read in his 4 booke. But I cannot omit this one thing which <hi>Heraclides</hi> in his Politicks doth recite: namely, that if anie man be ſo farre in debt that he is not able to paie, the boies do follow him holding vp vnto him, in mockery, an emptie purſe. The <hi>Etruſci</hi> were long ſince accounted verie wealthie. They were very ſtrong both by ſea and by land: and in warre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in ſtrength to the Romanes. <hi>Liuy</hi> (to whom <hi>Diodorus</hi> doth ſubſcribe) ſaith it is the richeſt prouince of <hi>Italy</hi> both for men, munition and money. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Camillus,</hi> ſaith, that this countrie did reach from the Alpes Northward as high as the Hadriaticke ſea, and Southward as low as the midland ſea. That there were 300. cities of the <hi>Vmbri,</hi> battered and taken by the <hi>Tuſci,</hi> we find recorded, ſaith <hi>Pliny.</hi> Such was the wealth and command of <hi>Etruria,</hi> that it did not onlie filll the land with an honourable report and fame of their name, but alſo euen the ſea all along from one end of <hi>Italy</hi> to the other. <hi>Liuy</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> do affirme that <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Atri</hi> were colonies of the <hi>Tuſci; Pomponius</hi> and <hi>Paterculus</hi> do ſay the like of <hi>Capua:</hi> as alſo of <hi>Nola,</hi> although that <hi>Solinus</hi> doth aſcribe this to the Tyrians (where I thinke the copie is corrupt, and for <hi>Tyrijs,</hi> I ſuppoſe it ſhould be written <hi>Tyrrhenis) Trogus</hi> and <hi>Silius Ital cus</hi> do affirme it to haue been built and firſt peopled by the <hi>Chaldicenſes.</hi> Yea <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his treatiſe of famous women, and againe in his Gretian queſtions, ſaith, that theſe <hi>Etruſci,</hi> in old time did poſſeſſe <hi>Lemnos, (Stalamine)</hi> and <hi>Imbrus (Lembro)</hi> certaine ilands in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> or Aegean ſea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tuſcus vicus,</hi> a ſtreet in <hi>Rome: Tuſculum</hi> and <hi>Tuſculanum,</hi> in <hi>Latium (Campagna di Roma)</hi> tooke their names from hence; Againe <hi>mare Tuſcum,</hi> called otherwiſe <hi>mare Inferum, Notium, Tyrrhenum,</hi> and <hi>Liburnum,</hi> (the Neather ſea, or South ſea, in reſpect of the Hadriaticke ſea which is called <hi>mare Superum,</hi> the vpper ſea, and is vpon the North from this countrie) as we find in <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi> About <hi>Puteoli (Pozzole)</hi> as <hi>Dion</hi> recordeth, there is a creeke of the ſea called <hi>Tyrrhenus ſinus,</hi> the bay of <hi>Tuſcane.</hi> But there are alſo other <hi>Tuſci,</hi> diuerſe from theſe in <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> as <hi>Ptolemey</hi> noteth: as alſo other Tyrrheni, in the ilands belonging to <hi>Attica,</hi> if you will beleeue <hi>Marſylus Lesbius.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ATIVM, which the excellent Poet Virgil ſyrnameth The Great, The Faire, and The Weſtern, by the deſcription of Auguſtus, who, as Pliny teſtifieth, diuided Italy in eleuen ſhires, the chiefe and principall of the reſt, was twofold, to wit, Latium The New, and Latium The Old. LATIVM VETVS, <hi>Olde Latium,</hi> beganne at the riuer Tiber, and extended it ſelfe euen vp as high as the Circaeian mountaines (or to Fundi, as Seruius ſayth.) LATIVM NOVVM, <hi>New Latium,</hi> from hence ſtretched it ſelfe vnto the riuer Liris, as Pliny and Strabo do ioyntly teſtifie: yea and farther, as they both affirme: For euen as low as Sinueſſa, (which was otherwiſe alſo called Sinope) being in that part which is named <hi>Adiectum Latium,</hi> the ſame Pliny calleth Latium beyond the Liris, which is indeed a part of Campania. Which peraduenture was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that moued Seruius to extend this Latium as farre that way as the riuer Vulturnus. So that the bounds of this Latium are the Tyrrhen ſea, the mount Apenninus, the riuers Tiber, Anio, and Liris. The neighbour Nations inhabiting round about it are the <hi>Tuſci, Sabini, Marſi, Samnites, Praegutiani,</hi> and the <hi>Campani.</hi> It was ſo named of the Verbe <hi>Lateo,</hi> ſignifying To lurke or Lie hid; for that Saturnus here did hide himſelfe, as Seruius writeth: and in trueth before him Herodianus, Eutropius, Cyprianus, and Minutius Felix do plainly affirme the ſame; yea and that Poet, which in all mens opinions is counted the beſt, in theſe his verſes. <hi>Primus ab aetherio venit Saturnus Olympo, Arma Iouis fugiens, &amp; regnis exul ademptis.

A god I am indeed, ſhew where I may me hide; For I haue loſt my regall crowne, by Ioues vntimely pride; And ſtill I feare his power, I dare him not abide. If that you'll grant me leaue with you to hide my head, Latium this countrey ſhalbe call'd long after I am dead. So that Solinus Polyhiſtor did not without iuſt cauſe make this demand: <hi>Who is he that knoweth not, that of Saturnus this countrey was named both Latium and Saturnia?</hi> But if any man ſhall ſuppoſe theſe reports to be fabulous and mere Poëticall fictions, let him heare the learned Varro ſpeake, an authour farre more ancient than all thoſe aforenamed, who affirmeth it to haue been ſo named, <hi>quòd lateat inter Alpium &amp; Apennini praecipitia,</hi> for that it is hid, encloſed or conteined betweene the ſteepe and craggie cliffes of the Alpes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penninus. But what ſhire, I pray you, in all Olde Italy is there, <hi>quae non aequè latet?</hi> that is not thus inuironed? If I poore gooſe might dare to keake amongſt theſe well tun'd ſwannes, I ſhould rather thinke it to haue gotten this name, not <hi>à latendo,</hi> of lurking, but <hi>à latitudine,</hi> of the bredth of it: For there is no other countrey of the right and ancient Italie, that betweene the ſea and thoſe mountaines doth ſpread it ſelfe more broad and wide euery way than this doth: and that the Geographicall charts and mappes of this prouince doe ſufficiently approoue. But let antiquity be ſtill beleeued, I poore foole will not impeach their credit, leſt at laſt it turne to mine owne diſcredit. There are ſome, as Hieronymus Columna, writing vpon the fragments of the famous Poet Ennius, reporteth, which thinke that this name <hi>Saturnus</hi> is a meere Syrian word, and in that language to ſignifie the ſame that <hi>latens</hi> (that is, one that playeth leaſt in ſight) doth in Latine: And hereupon thoſe ancients, as it were, interpreting the word, haue called that ſhire and countrey where the Latines dwelt, LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVM Trueth it is, and all learned in theſe orientall tongues can beare me witneſſe, that the Hebrew thema <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

That the inhabitants or people of this countrey were called <hi>Latini,</hi> Strabo with all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers of the Romane hiſtories doth plainly teach vs, denominated of <hi>Latinus</hi> a king of this prouince, according to that of Virgil — <hi>genus vnde Latinum,</hi> From whom the Latines tooke their name. Pliny alſo maketh mention of the <hi>Latinienſes,</hi> a nation of this prouince; but extinct ſomething before his time, as he there addeth. Theſe were called <hi>Priſci,</hi> as Halicarnaſſeus and Feſtus doe teſtifie. Of the nature of this countrey Strabo in the fifth booke of his Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy writeth thus: All Latium, ſayth he, generally is a very good ſoile and fertile of all maner of things, except only ſome certeine places neere the ſea coaſt, which are moriſh and very vnhealthfull; as namely the fields about Ardea, and whatſoeuer is betweene Lauinium and Antium, euen as farre as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metia, with ſome places about Setia; and others neere Tarracina and Circeium; beſide all thoſe fields that are ſtony and mountainous; although euen theſe grounds are not altogether idle and vnfruitfull: all of them hauing either ſome good paſtures and large woods, or doe yeeld great abundance of fenny and mountainous commodities. Caecubum, a place in this fenne, doth yeeld a kinde of vine which groweth vp in height like a tree, whoſe wine is counted to be the beſt of all Italy. Heare alſo what Theophraſtus writeth of this prouince in the fift booke of his hiſtory of Plants, at the ninth chapter of the ſame booke: <hi>Latinus ager,</hi> the countrey of Latium, ſayth he, hath great plenty of water. The champion plaines haue great ſtore of laurell and myrtle trees: item they yeeld a wonderfull kinde of beech (<hi>ſciſſima,</hi> he calleth it, or <hi>oxea,</hi> as others terme it) of that maruellous length, that one tree may ſerue for a whole keele for ſuch kinde of ſhips as they commonly vſe in Etruria. The hilly and mountainous places doe beare the pine and firre trees. Pliny doth highly commend the wines of Latium, <hi>(Latinienſia vina.)</hi> The ſame authour affirmeth that their chiefe meat was <hi>far,</hi> that is, a kinde of bearded or redde wheat; and withall, teſtifieth that it is certaine that the Romans for a long time together liued with <hi>puls,</hi> by which they vnderſtand all maner of corne beſide wheat and barley, not with bread. How populous this countrey was, how many cities and people it conteined, the ſame authour doth teach vs, where he writeth that in Old <hi>Latium</hi> only three and fiftie nations are vtterly decayed and extinct without any mention at all remaining of their names. Item, that <hi>Pomptina palus,</hi> the fen Pontina (now called <hi>Aufente palude</hi>) a part alſo of this countrey, had in former times in it three and twentie cities. Of all the cities of Latium, in olde time Alba longa was the chiefe and metropolitan: but afterward Rome, which grew to that greatneſſe and power that it was not only the head of this prouince, but alſo euen of the whole world beſide. Whoſe other name, becauſe it is held an vnlawfull thing to ſpeake that which is concealed and enrowled in cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious myſteries, I will not vtter, leſt with Valerius Soranus, I be worthily puniſhed for the ſame. Yet the ſyrnames, epithets, and commendable titles where with it was graced and ſet out by the beſt writers of all nations, if I ſhall here reckon vp, I hope there is no man, that is an indifferent Iudge, that will blame me.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Liny and Pomponius Mela call this mountaine CIRCEIVM MONTEM: Strabo and Ptolemey CIRCAEVM. but an ancient inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in this ſame place calleth it CIRCAEVM, denominated as ancient writers affirme of <hi>Circes,</hi> the famous ſorcereſſe, who ſometime dwelt here, as they verily beleeued. Whereupon Mela and Solinus, as alſo Ouid himſelfe, nameth it <hi>Circes domum,</hi> Circes houſe. Item Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius in like maner calleth it Circes habitacle, &amp; Ae AE AE <hi>portum,</hi> (with three diphthongs, as Seruius obſerueth in Virgil) the Aeaean hauen. It was ſo called, as the ſame Grammarian writeth, of a contemptuous word vſed by thoſe which paſſed by that way, which they vttered in contempt of thoſe her witchcrafts &amp; ſorceries, whereby ſhe turned men into ſwine, practiſed in this place. This was long ſince an iland, and inuironed round with the ocean ſea, but now by continuance of time it is ioyned to the continent, as Solinus teſtifieth. The like doth Pliny affirme of it; It was, ſayth he, ſometime incloſed round with the maine ſea, as Homer ſeemeth to thinke, but now it ſtandeth vpon the firme land. But was not Homer deceiued? ſurely ſo Procopius, in the firſt booke of his <hi>Gothica,</hi> ſeemeth to thinke. Of the mountaine <hi>Circeius,</hi> ſayth he, where they report Vlyſſes had conference with the enchantreſſe <hi>Circe,</hi> as I thinke, they ſpeake many things that are not true: except that peraduenture one might ſay that this mountaine was therefore an iland, for that it ſhooteth out an huge way into the vaſt ocean &amp;c. And although that Homer heere hath Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, in his hiſtory of Plants, and Seruius in his Commentaries vpon Virgils Aeneides, vpon his ſide, as Patrons of fabulous antiquity, yet that I ſhould rather leane vnto Procopius, the opinion of the learned M. Iſaac Caſaubon, who in thoſe his laborious Commentaries vpon the Geography of Strabo hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that oft times amongſt the beſt Geographers, Ilands and Promontories are confounded, and one put for another: ſo that that which one authour termeth a promontory, another calleth by the name of an ile or a neckland. Therefore I do willingly preferre the deſcription of Strabo of this place, before thoſe deſcriptions of any other authours whatſoeuer, as more true and probable. From Antium, ſayth he, two hundred foure ſcore and ten furlongs, is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate mount Circello <hi>[Circaeum]</hi> an hill inuironed partly with the ſea and partly with mooriſh fennes and bogges. Thoſe things alſo which the Poets do tell of the witchcraft of the ſorcereſſe Circe, and that fabulous tranſmutation and changing of men into diuers and ſundry formes or ſhapes, with Seruius I doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attribute to the force of nature, than to magicke or witchcraft. namely, of the horrour of thoſe which paſſe by that way, whereby men do ſeeme to be changed into beaſts. and with Pliny I may ſay, How infinite are thoſe fables that are tolde of Medea of Colchis, and others, but eſpecially of our Italian Circe, who for her excellent skill in the arte magicke was canonized for a goddeſſe? And be it farre from me, and from euery Chriſtian man, that we ſhould beleeue thoſe things which it were wicked and profane to thinke or imagine. For I haue read in the Ancyrane councell, that they are woorſe than Pagans and infidels, who doe beleeue that any creature may by any man be turned and transformed into any other ſhape or ſimilitude, than by the Creatour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who firſt gaue them that forme and faſhion. Therefore let all other men ſay what they will, and perſwade what they can, they ſhall neuer make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue theſe fables. It ſeemeth that the fable aroſe of the nature and quality of the place. for thoſe places which lie out into the ſea, as this promontory doth, are woont to be in more danger of ſtorme and windes than any other places whatſoeuer. Which blaſts, accompanied with the waues, ebbes and tides of the ſourging ſea, falling vpon the rocks, cliffes and hollow places, do cauſe ſuch ſundry ſounds and noices, that ſuch as doe ſaile by this way, not without a great horrour and trembling, doe ſeeme as if they heard at one inſtant men mourne, lions roare, wolues howle, dogs barke, hogs grunt, and beares to make a noice. Hither do thoſe words of Lucan in his ſixt booke belong; <hi>Omnia ſubducit Circaeae vela procellae.</hi> That this promontory is full of trees, eſpecially of okes, myrtles, and bay-trees, Theophraſtus writeth from the relation of others. Strabo ſayth that it aboundeth with diuers ſorts of roots: peraduenture, as there he addeth, they affirme this of it, that they may the better apply it in all reſpects vnto the fable of Circe. And do you not thinke that this ſaying of Ariſtotle the Prince of Philoſophers, in his <hi>Admiranda,</hi> did ariſe from hence? They report, ſayth he, that in the mount Circello there groweth a deadly poiſon, of ſuch great force, that ſo ſoone as euer it is taken, all the haire of the body immediatly falleth off, and it ſo weakeneth all the parts and members of the ſame, that they wex ſo litly and dwined, that outwardly they beare the ſhew of dead carkeiſes, ſuch as it would grieue any man to beholde. Strabo writeth that in this mountaine was an altar dedicated to Minerua. and withall there is to this day to be ſeene a certeine goblet or bowle of Vlyſſes. but this latter he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be from the opinion and report of the vulgar ſort only. But paſſing ouer theſe fables, let vs returne againe vnto the hiſtoricall narration of ſuch things as in trueth are either here found or haue happened in this place. Horace hath left recorded, that the ſea vpon this coaſt yeeldeth great ſtore of good oiſters, which thereof are called <hi>Oſtrea Circaeia.</hi> Suetonius reporteth that Marcus Lepidus was by Auguſtus Caeſar for euer confined and baniſhed into this place. Plutarch writeth that Iulius Caeſar had a purpoſe, hard beneath the city, by a deepe channell to conuey the riuer Tiber another way, and to turne the courſe thereof toward this <hi>Circaeium promontorium,</hi> and ſo to haue cauſed it to fall into the ſea, at the city Anxur: by which meanes thoſe which for trade and trafficke were by ſhip to trauell vp to Rome, he meant to make their paſſage more eaſie and ſafe; but being preuented by death, performed not what he had purpoſed. Here alſo was the city CIRCAEIVM or <hi>Circaeia,</hi> or as Strabo termeth it <hi>Circes towne.</hi> That it was made a colony of the Romans by Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Liuy, Halicarnaſſeus, Cicero and Plutarch, do ioyntly teſtifie. Strabo ſayth that it hath a good and conuenient hauen. I would thinke that the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or plot of this ancient citie <hi>Circaeia</hi> doth ſtill remaine in this mountaine in that place where in this deſcription thou ſeeſt certeine ruines and foundations of the walles, as it were of a city raſed long ſince and layd leuell almoſt with the ground: which place at this day is called by the name of <hi>Citta vecchia,</hi> that is as much to ſay, as, The old citie. Certeine remnants of this name doth yet remaine to be ſeene engrauen in the top of this ſame mountaine, as Angelus Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentanus, a man of good credit, the authour of this deſcription, and a moſt diligent ſearcher out of the Romane antiquities, doth from his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge plainly teſtifie, yet much defaced, as he alſo affirmeth, and worne out with continuance of time, to wit, in this forme;

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat a great part of the true and ancient <hi>Italy</hi> (if not all of it) together with all <hi>Sicily</hi> was ſometime called by the name of GREAT GREECE, I thinke there is no man meanly ſeen in Geographie that maketh any doubt: for the <hi>Grecians</hi> did in former times poſſeſſe, as <hi>Trogus</hi> writeth, not only a part, but welnigh all <hi>Italy.</hi> Liſten what <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the fifth chapter of his third booke, ſaith, Of it the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, a Nation very prodigall in commending themſelues, haue giuen their verdict, in that they haue named a great part of it <hi>Great Greece.</hi> Hither alſo pertaine thoſe wordes of <hi>Feſtus. Italy</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Great Greece,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Siculi,</hi> ſometime paſſed it, or for that many and the greateſt cities of it, were built by the Grecians. <hi>Seruius</hi> in his Commentaries vpon the firſt of <hi>Virgils</hi> Aeneids, writeth thus: <hi>Italy</hi> was termed <hi>Megale Hellas,</hi> Great <hi>Greece,</hi> for that all the cities from <hi>Taranto, (Tarentum)</hi> euen vnto <hi>Cumae,</hi> were firſt founded by the Grecians. And therefore it was not altogether vnfitly of <hi>Plautus</hi> in his <hi>Menechmis,</hi> called <hi>Graecia exotica,</hi> outlandiſh <hi>Greece. Seneca,</hi> in his Conſolation, thus ſpeaketh of it: All that ſide of <hi>Italy,</hi> which coaſteth along with the Neather ſea <hi>(Mar Toſco)</hi> was called <hi>Great Greece.</hi> That <hi>Campania (Terra di lauoro)</hi> was poſſeſſed by the Grecians, <hi>Pliny</hi> doth plainly affirme. <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> in his ſix and twentieth Oration deſcribeth <hi>Auernus lacus,</hi> the lake of <hi>Tipergola,</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> to be within the compaſſe of <hi>Great Greece.</hi> And that theſe authours ſpeake truth, <hi>Trogus</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſheweth in the twentith booke of his hiſtory, in theſe wordes: The <hi>Tuſci</hi> which dwell along by the coaſt of the Neather ſea, came from <hi>Lydia: Item,</hi> the Venetians <hi>(Veneti)</hi> which now we ſee to be ſeated neere the vpper-ſea, <hi>(Golfo di Venetia,</hi> the Hadriaticke ſea) <hi>Troy,</hi> when it was taken and ſacked, ſent thither vnder the conduct of <hi>Antenor:</hi> moreouer, the city <hi>Adria (Atri)</hi> which firſt gaue name to the Adriaticke ſea, neere neighbour vnto the Illirian ſea, is a city built by the Greekes: <hi>Diomedes,</hi> after the ouerthrow of <hi>Troy,</hi> built the city <hi>Arpi, (Sarpi,</hi> or <hi>Monte S.

Whereupon all that part of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> was called GREAT GREECE. Thus farre <hi>Iuſtine</hi> out of <hi>Trogus Pompeius.</hi> Whereby we gather, that the pleaſant poet <hi>Ouid</hi> in the fourth booke of his <hi>Faſtorum,</hi> did ſpeake but the truth, when he ſaid: <hi>Itala nam tellus Graecia Maior erat:</hi> For <hi>Grecia</hi> Great, that land was called, which now <hi>Italia</hi> hight: and ſo foorth, as followeth in the ſame place.

And if we will not giue credit vnto <hi>Seruius,</hi> yet againſt <hi>Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> a writer of good credit, we cannot except, who hath written the very ſelfe ſame thing: namely, that the <hi>Siculi,</hi> a people borne and bred in <hi>Italy,</hi> and did firſt of all nations whatſoeuer inhabite and poſſeſſe the Romane ſoile. Laſtly, that this prouince, called <hi>Great Greece,</hi> was inhabited of the <hi>Siculi, Strabo</hi> in the fith booke of his Geography doth teſtifie out of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Thus farre of that ancient <hi>Great Greece,</hi> or, if you pleaſe ſo to call it, of <hi>Sicilia:</hi> all which we haue not deſcribed in this Mappe, but only the outter part of it; in which, beſide <hi>Calabria, Apulia,</hi> the <hi>Brutij</hi> and <hi>Locri:</hi> there is <hi>Great Greece,</hi> properly ſo called by <hi>Ptolemey, Liuy, Polybius, Athenaeus</hi> and <hi>Valerius Maximus:</hi> and that, as <hi>Strabo</hi> in his ſixth booke, and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his 2 booke of his Oratour, thinke becauſe <hi>Pythagoras the Grecian Philoſopher</hi> dwelt ſometime in theſe quarters; or, as <hi>Syneſius</hi> in his oration <hi>de Dono</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, for that it alwaies maintained and brought foorth <hi>ſchollerlike and militarie men.</hi> Yet I rather relie vpon the iudgement of <hi>Atheneus,</hi> who writeth that it was ſo called of the <hi>infinite number of Grecians</hi> which vſually dwelt in this prouince.

The ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> compareth this tract to the forme of the <hi>Amazonian ſhield,</hi> that is, to the <hi>halfe moone,</hi> as <hi>Seruius</hi> expoundeth it, at that verſe of the firſt booke of <hi>Virgils</hi> Aeneides, <hi>Ducit, Amazonidum lunatis agmina peltis.</hi> There is in theſe quarters, the <hi>wood Sila (La Sila)</hi> of which <hi>Saluſt, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Vibius</hi> haue made mention. <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth that it is ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred furlongs in length: full of goodly tall trees and well ſtored with good water. <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> in the twelfth booke of his <hi>Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> vnto <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> doth highly commend the <hi>cheeſe</hi> made heere about.

But of the Nature, Situation, proper Qualities, and Antiquities of this prouince I will not ſpeake one word more; becauſe the ſame is moſt exactly and learnedly done by two learned men both borne heere, who therefore knew it well, before I began once to ſet pen to paper to draw this my Mappe: I meane <hi>Gabriel Barrius,</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>Calabria,</hi> where he ſo largely and curiouſly tricked out <hi>Great Greece, Brutium</hi> and the tract poſſeſſed ſometime by the <hi>Locri,</hi> that euen that Reader, which hardly will be ſatisfied with ſuch like ſtories, may doubtleſſe heere take his fill: and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony Galatey,</hi> who hath painted out his <hi>Iapygia,</hi> (which is in truth the ancient <hi>Calabria</hi>) that his Reader ſhall not only depart skilfull and cunning in the knowledge of this country, bur alſo much bettered in his vnderſtanding and inſtructed with rules of good learning and Philoſophy: in him alſo there is a deſcription of the city <hi>Gallipoli:</hi> Of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> a city of this prouince, <hi>Iohannes Iuuenis</hi> harh ſet out a ſeuerall treatiſe.

Whether euery one of theſe were knowen to the ancients by ſeuerall names or not, I know not. <hi>Feſtus, Stephanus</hi> and others, call properly one of theſe <hi>Inſula Diomedea,</hi> Diomedes ile, like as amongſt the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicae inſulae,</hi> the Brittiſh iles, one is properly named <hi>Britannia,</hi> Brittaine.

They are ſeated in the Adriaticke ſea, not farre from the ſea-coaſt of <hi>Puglia,</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Monte de S. Angelo, Mons Garganus,</hi> or <hi>Promontorium Garganum.</hi> Not within kenning or ſight of <hi>Taranto (Tarentum)</hi> a city of <hi>Apulia,</hi> as very falſly, at the ſame place, <hi>Seruius</hi> hath ſet downe. The name was deriued by the teſtimony of all writers both Latines and Greekes, from <hi>Diomedes</hi> the king of <hi>Aetolia, (Artinia, Nicetas</hi> calleth it) whom they report, after the ſurpriſing of <hi>Troy,</hi> in his returne homeward, not being enterteined of his owne nation, to be driuen hither and to be interred heere, and that his temple, monument or tombe did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the greateſt of them properly called <hi>Diomedea (S.

In <hi>Platina,</hi> in the life of <hi>Hadrian</hi> the firſt, I read, that <hi>Paullus Diaconus</hi> was once condemned thither, by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. Of <hi>Diomedes</hi> birds (which <hi>Iuba</hi> calleth <hi>Catarractae:</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>Charadrij:</hi> of others, <hi>Erodij,</hi> a kind of Cormorant or rauenous ſea foule) proper to theſe ilands (for they are onely to be ſeene in this one place of all the world, if we may beleeue old writers) read <hi>Ouid</hi> in the thirteenth booke of his Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis, where he thus ſpeaketh of them: <hi>Si volucrum quae ſit dubiarum forma requiris, Vt non cignorum, ſic albis proxima cignis.</hi> The doubtfull formes of birds moſt ſtrange, if that you ſeeke to know: They be no ſwannes, yet white they be, as white as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſnow. <hi>Suidas</hi> maketh them to be like to ſtorkes. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Wonders, calleth them vaſte and huge birdes with very long, and bigge bils. <hi>Pliny</hi> with <hi>Solinus</hi> do write that they be like the <hi>Fulica,</hi> a kinde of coote: of colour white, hauing teeth and eies of a fiery ſparke. Some there are which do thinke them to be <hi>Heronſhawes. Robert Conſtantine</hi> teſtifieth that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people of theſe ilands do now call them <hi>Artenae:</hi> and that they make a noiſe like the crying of yong children. <hi>Item,</hi> that the fatte or greaſe of them is a ſoueraigne remedie againſt diſeaſes ariſing of cold cauſes. <hi>Blondus</hi> writeth that he vnderſtood by ſome of the inhabitants of theſe iles, that theſe fowles, ſtill retaining the name of the <hi>Diomedean</hi> birdes, are of the bigneſſe of a gooſe. But to be very harmeleſſe creatures, yet neither doing them, nor the Church any maner of pleaſure. They which deſire to know more of theſe birdes, as alſo of the Metamorphoſis and tranſmutation of <hi>Diomedes</hi> conſorts into theſe fowles, or of their nature and quality, as of their kindneſſe toward Grecians (<hi>honeſt-men, Strabo</hi> calleth them) and their curſtneſſe to ſtrangers, (<hi>wicked-men,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> hath) and of the purifying of the temple, and of other poeticall fables deuiſed of them, let them haue recourſe to the authours aboue named: to which they may ad that liſt, that which <hi>Aelianus</hi> hath written in the firſt c. of his 1. booke S. <hi>Aug.</hi> in the 16 c. of his 18 book <hi>De ciuitate Dei; Antigonius, Antony Liberalis, Lycophron,</hi> and his Scholiaſt <hi>Iſacius.</hi> At this day theſe ilands are vnder the command of the kingdome of <hi>Naples:</hi> &amp; are al generally called by one name <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitanae,</hi> ilands <hi>de Trimite:</hi> &amp; euery one by a ſeueral &amp; proper name by it ſelfe, as thou maiſt read in our Geographical treaſury.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat this was ſometime a <hi>peninſula,</hi> or demy-ile, adioined to <hi>Italy,</hi> as a part of <hi>Brutium</hi> in <hi>Calabria</hi> neere to <hi>Rhegium (Rhezzo)</hi> and afterward was by violence of tempeſt ſeuered from the ſame (and of that accident the city <hi>Rhegium</hi> tooke the name) it is a generall opinion of all antiquity. But when, or at what certaine time, this diuiſion happened, there is not any memoriall, for ought I know, remaining in any ancient writer. <hi>Strabo, Pliny</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> do write that it was cauſed by an earthquake: <hi>Silius</hi> and <hi>Caſsiodorus,</hi> do thinke it to haue been done by the rage and violence of the tide and ſurges of the ſea. They which lend their liſtening eares to fables, do attribute the cauſe of it to <hi>Neptune</hi> (as <hi>Euſtathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> witneſſeth) who, with his three-tined mace, in fauour of <hi>Iocaſtus,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> diuided it from the maine land, and ſo made it an iland, which before was but a demy-ile; that by that meanes he might the more ſafely inhabite and poſſeſſe the ſame. <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> moued by the authority of <hi>Heſiodus,</hi> aſcribeth to <hi>Orion:</hi> who, that he might be compared to <hi>Hercules,</hi> cutting through the rockes and mountaines, firſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Sicilian ſtreights, as he did of <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> Therefore <hi>Trinacria quondam Italae pars vna fuit; ſed pontus &amp; aeſtus Mutaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſitum, rupit confinia Nereus Victor: &amp; abſciſsos interluit aequore montes, &amp;c.</hi> They which eſteeme the ilands of the midland ſea, according to their quantity and content, do make this the greateſt, as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> who affirme this not only to excell the reſt for bigneſſe, but alſo for goodneſſe of ſoile. As concerning the forme of this iland, <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> ſaith it is like that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall letter of the Greekes, which they call <hi>Delta.</hi> That the whole iland was conſecrated to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Libera,</hi> that is, <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> all old writers do generally with one conſent affirme: to <hi>Ceres</hi> it was dedicated, becauſe it firſt taught the rules of ſetting &amp; ſowing of corne: to <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> not ſo much for that ſhe was from hence violently taken by <hi>Pluto,</hi> as for that (which <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> do report for truth) <hi>Pluto,</hi> as ſoone as ſhe vncouering her ſelfe firſt ſhewed herſelfe to be ſeene of him, gaue it her for a boone; which kind of gifts and fauours the Greekes call <hi>anacalypteria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the fertility and riches of this country, there is a famous teſtimonie, written by the learned Oratour <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his ſecond ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>Verres,</hi> where he ſaith that <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> did call it, <hi>The garner and ſtorehouſe of the Romane common wealth, and the nurce of the vulgar ſort.</hi> The ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> doth adde in that place, that it was not only the ſtorehouſe of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it was accounted for a well furniſhed treaſurie: for without any coſt or charge of ours ſaith he, it hath vſually clothed, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and furniſhed our greateſt armies with leather, apparell and corne. <hi>Strabo</hi> in his 6. booke reporteth almoſt the ſame thing of it. Whatſoeuer <hi>Sicilia</hi> doth yeeld, ſaith <hi>Solinus,</hi> whether by the kindneſſe and temperature of the aire, or by the induſtry and labour of man, it is accounted next vnto thoſe things that are of beſt eſtimation: were it not that ſuch things as the earth firſt putteth forth are ouergrowen with <hi>Centorui</hi> ſaffron <hi>(Crocus Ceturipinus). Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Admiranda,</hi> writeth, that about <hi>Pelorus (Cabo de la torre del Faro)</hi> ſaffron groweth in ſuch abundance, that any man that liſteth may load and carie it away by whole cart loads. But <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> doth affirme, that that which groweth about <hi>Centuripinum</hi> (a towne now called <hi>Centorui</hi>) is much weaker and of leſſe force, than that which groweth in other places. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, that in the fields neere <hi>Leontium, (Lintini)</hi> and in diuers other places of this iland, wheat doth grow of it ſelfe, without any labour or looking to of the husbandman. That this iland was made a prouince firſt before any other forren nation, amongſt other <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> haue left recorded. <hi>Martianus</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there were in it 6. colonies, and 60. cities. <hi>Pintianus,</hi> at the 8. c. of <hi>Plinies</hi> 3. booke, readeth 73. free colonies &amp; cities. <hi>Silius</hi> in his 14. booke, and <hi>Ouid</hi> in diuers places reckoneth vp the names of many of them: but this our mappe ſpeaketh of many more.</p>
            <p>That it was in the beginning poſſeſſed and inhabited by <hi>Giants, Laeſtrigones, Anthropophagi,</hi> and <hi>Cyclopes</hi> barbarous and vnci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill nations, all hiſtories and fables do iointly with one conſent auerre. Yet <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſaith that theſe ſauage people dwelt only in one place of the iland. Afterward the <hi>Sicani,</hi> a nation of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſo called of the riuer <hi>Sicanus,</hi> (or as <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Beroſus,</hi> haue giuen out, of their king <hi>Sicanus</hi>) driuen out of their country by the <hi>Ligures,</hi> poſſeſſed it. That theſe <hi>Sicani</hi> were not bred in the ile (although ſome do ſo thinke) <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> do conſtantly auouch. Of theſe it was named SICANIA. The <hi>Elymi</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes,</hi> ſeated themſelues heere: after them ſucceeded the <hi>Phryges</hi> driuen from <hi>Troy,</hi> as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> thinketh: and the <hi>Morgetes</hi> expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Oenotri,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth. In <hi>Plutarch</hi> his <hi>Conuiual. Quaeſt.</hi> and <hi>Iulius Pollux</hi> his 2. booke <hi>de Manibus,</hi> I read that the <hi>Dores</hi> ſometime did inhabite it. Laſtly, it was all conquered by the <hi>Siculi,</hi> a people of <hi>Italy</hi> ouerthrowen &amp; caſt out of their poſſeſſions by the <hi>Opici,</hi> and of them it was called SICILIA; when as before it was knowen by the name of TRINACIA, as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: or TRINACRIS, as <hi>Ouid:</hi> or TRINACRIA and TRIQVETRA, as <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth, of the triangular forme. Whereupon the Romans in their money were wont to counterfait or expreſſe this prouince by 3. legs ioined together about the vpper end of the thigh, (not much vnlike thoſe armes of the E. of <hi>Darby,</hi> as I thinke,) <hi>Lycophron</hi> for the ſame reaſon giueth it the title or epithite of TRICERVIX, 3. necked: and <hi>Pindarus</hi> in like maner calleth it TRICVSPIS, 3. pointed. <hi>Homer</hi> the prince of poets nameth it CYCLOPVM TERRA, the land of the <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> being peraduenture in his time not knowen by any proper name. <hi>Iulius Firmicus,</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Siculi,</hi> the people of this iland, are acute and nimble witted: <hi>Quint.</hi> in his 6. booke of his <hi>Orat.</hi> ſaith that they are laſciuious and full of words.</p>
            <p>Beſides many famous acts done by theſe people both at home and abroad, aſwell in peace as in war there be many other things which haue made this iland very renowmed: the birth of <hi>Ceres,</hi> the rauiſhing of <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> the Giant <hi>Enceladus,</hi> the wonderfull mathematician <hi>Archimedes,</hi> the famous geometrician <hi>Euclide,</hi> the painfull hiſtorian <hi>Diodorus, Empedocles</hi> the deep philoſopher, the ingenious architecture of <hi>Daedalus,</hi> the tombe of <hi>Sibylla Cumana, Syracuſae</hi> the famous <hi>tetrapolis,</hi> or as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, a <hi>pentapolis</hi> (one city made of 4. or 5. cities: like as <hi>London,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Southwarke,</hi> may be ſaid to be a <hi>tripolis</hi>) the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> the lake <hi>Palicus,</hi> the mount <hi>AEtna, Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis,</hi> and the notorious harlot <hi>Lais.</hi> Beſide many miracles and wonderfull workes of nature, which thou maiſt read of in <hi>Solinus, Trogus</hi> in his fourth booke, <hi>Antigonus de Mirab. l.</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles Statius</hi> in his 2. booke of <hi>Loue: Item</hi> ſtatues coſtly images, for art and curious workemanſhip of great eſtimation; which are deſcribed by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his orations againſt <hi>Verres. Athenaeus</hi> commended highly the cheeſe, doues and diuers ſorts of garments of <hi>Sicilia. Antigonus</hi> writeth that the <hi>Cactos</hi> (a kind of thorne) doth grow in this ile, and not in any other place of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> affirmeth: vpon which if a ſtagge ſhall tread and pricke his foote, his bones will yeeld no ſound, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they wilbe naught to make pipes of. Heere alſo, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, is found the <hi>Smaragde,</hi> a kind of pretious ſtone, of great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in thoſe daies: in the ſea, the ſame authour affirmeth, that Corall is gotten by ſuch as do ſeeke for it. <hi>Iulius Pollux</hi> doth write, that this iland had at firſt no hares, but ſuch as were brought in by <hi>Anaxilas Rhegnius</hi> The Sicilian ſea, which beateth vpon this ile on the Eaſt ſide, was alſo called <hi>Auſonium mare,</hi> and was the deepeſt of all the Mediterran ſea, as <hi>Strabo</hi> teſtifieth. There is another iland in this ſea neere to <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> called <hi>Sicilia,</hi> as <hi>Stephanus</hi> reporteth. The ile <hi>Naxus (Nicſia,</hi> it is now called in the <hi>AEgean</hi> or <hi>Archipelago, Pliny</hi> ſaith, was ſometime named <hi>Sicilia minor, Sicilia,</hi> the leſſe. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> alſo ſpeaketh of <hi>Sicilia</hi> a little hill not farre from <hi>Athens</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> Moreouer there is a place in the Palace of <hi>Rome,</hi> of that name, as <hi>Capitolinus</hi> hath left recorded in the life of <hi>Perlinax</hi> the Emperour. But theſe are by-matters nor ſo directly to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Diuers adagies, prouerbs, or by-words haue ſprong from hence: as <hi>Siculiſſare,</hi> ſpoken of one that is ſullen or tetchie: <hi>Siculum mare,</hi> the Sicilian ſea, meaning that which is dangerous: <hi>Siculus miles,</hi> A Sicilian ſouldier, that is, a mercenary or ſtipendary: <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae gerrae,</hi> and <hi>Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim,</hi> He falleth vpon the rockes that laboureth to ſhunne the quicke ſands; ſpoken of him that coueting to eſcape one danger falleth into a worſe. But of theſe and ſuch like thou maiſt read <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his <hi>Chiliades.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He inhabitants of DACIA, the Greekes called DACI: the Latines GETAE; as <hi>Pliny, Dion, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus</hi> and others do teſtifie: (This alſo <hi>Cottiſo,</hi> ſometime the King of that nation, doth confirme: whom <hi>Suetonius</hi> nameth, <hi>The king of the Getes;</hi> Horace calleth him, <hi>Dacum:</hi> a Dake) <hi>Item, Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandes</hi> ſaith, that the Romanes indifferently called them DACI, or GOTHI. I do obſerue that <hi>Herodotus</hi> and the writers about that age haue generally comprehended them vnder the name of the SCYTHAE, <hi>Scythians:</hi> to whom alſo the foreſaid <hi>Iornandes</hi> doth wholly aſſent and agree, <hi>Item,</hi> the abouenamed <hi>Stephanus</hi> nameth them DAOS and <hi>Strabo</hi> DAVOS, <hi>Daces,</hi> or <hi>Dawes,</hi> who notwithſtanding maketh this diſtinction betweene them: that the <hi>Getae</hi> were thoſe which were ſeated farther Eaſtward; the <hi>Daci,</hi> thoſe which dwelt more into the Weſt: Notwithſtanding they ſpeake one and the ſame language: namely, the Duche tongue, vſed alſo by the <hi>Thracians,</hi> as may be demonſtrated out of <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Iornandes.</hi> Moreouer <hi>Arrianus</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Getae</hi> were alſo called APATHONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZONTES: but it is to be amended: and out of <hi>Herodotus</hi> firſt booke, to be written ATHANATIZONTES, as who ſay, <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:</hi> for they do verily beleeue, that they ſhal neuer die: but after their departure out of this life, go preſently vnto one <hi>Zamolxis,</hi> a Saint or Idol which they eſpecially worſhip and adore. But of this their Saint and ceremonie you may read more in the ſaid authour. <hi>Suidas</hi> ſheweth that in his time theſe people were knowen by the name of the PATZINACITAE. That thoſe Dakes did inhabite on either ſide of the riuer <hi>Donaw (Danubius)</hi> euen vp as high as mount <hi>Haemus,</hi> I do find recorded by <hi>Dion:</hi> whom I do perceiue, vnder that name, to conteine alſo the <hi>Moeſi.</hi> And indeed we ſhall heereafter proue that the ſame Dakes were often tranſlated afterward into theſe Moeſiaes. Therefore Saint <hi>Paullinus,</hi> for that reaſon, maketh this ſame DACIA twofold, in his treatiſe Of the returne of <hi>Nicetas,</hi> in this verſe; <hi>Et Getae currunt, &amp; vterque Dacus:</hi> The Getes in troupes doe throng, both Dakes they do the like. In the Digeſts of the ciuill law mention is made of two Daciaes. But of the Moeſiaes we will ſpeake heereafter, this place we haue aſſigned to the true DACIA, properly ſo called, whoſe bounds <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> the Prince of all Geographers, maketh to be the riuers <hi>Donaw (Danubius) Teiſſa (Tibiſcus</hi> or <hi>Pathiſſus,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> nameth it) <hi>Pruth (Hieraſus)</hi> and the mount <hi>Carpates. Iornandes,</hi> this countrie man borne, ſaith, that the next neighbours to this <hi>Dacia,</hi> vpon the Eaſt, are the <hi>Roxolani;</hi> vpon the Weſt, the <hi>Tamazites: (Zyges</hi> I would rather read, moued ſo to thinke by likeliehood and probability of the thing it ſelfe: as alſo by the diuers reading of another copy, which hath <hi>Taziges,</hi> a word no where elſe found) vpon the North, it hath the <hi>Sarmatae</hi> and the <hi>Baſtarnae:</hi> and on the South, the riuer <hi>Donaw (Danubius.)</hi> This <hi>Dacia,</hi> as the ſame authour ſaith, oueragainſt <hi>Moeſia,</hi> beyond the <hi>Donaw,</hi> is encloſed round with mountaines, and hath only two paſſages in and out; one by <hi>Bontas (Rotteothurn)</hi> and <hi>Tabae (Broſſ.) Xiphiline,</hi> I thinke, calleth this later <hi>Taphae. Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> to this addeth <hi>Succorum anguſtias,</hi> the ſtreights of <hi>Turkzueſt,</hi> by the towne <hi>Succi. Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Marcellinus, Comes,</hi> the booke of Remembrances, and the Miſcellan ſtory, do diuide this country into two prouinces, MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERRANEA and RIPENSIS: There are ſome (of which <hi>Lazius</hi> is one) that to thoſe do adde a third called ALPESTRIS, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground and proofe, I know not. VANNIANVM REGNVM, of which <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> do ſpeake, was, as ſeemeth heere abouts. This is properly that prouince of <hi>Dacia,</hi> which <hi>Eutropius</hi> ſaith did conteine in circuite a thouſand miles. The chiefe city of this part was <hi>Zarmiſogethuſa,</hi> which afterward was called COLONIA VLPIA TRAIANA AVG. DACIC. ZARMIS. as we find in certaine inſcriptions in Marble, and was ſo named of <hi>Vlpius Traianus</hi> the Emperour. For he firſt by conquering ouercomming their king <hi>Decebalus,</hi> made it a prouince. Of which warre, made by <hi>Traiane</hi> againſt the Dakes, (for the hiſtories of it, written by himſelfe, cited by <hi>Priſcian</hi> the Grammarian, are loſt) you may read in <hi>Dion</hi> in the life of this Emperour. Behold alſo and view the columne ſet vp by the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Traianes</hi> market place, which yet to this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth whole and ſound. This columne, <hi>Hieronymus Mutianus</hi> the famous painter, ſhaddowed out with his owne hand and imprinted at <hi>Rome,</hi> in 130. tables. The ſame hath <hi>F. Alphonſus Ciacconus</hi> ſo liuely expreſſed and declared with ſuch a learned and laborious Commentary, that in it a man would thinke that he had rather ſeen this battell fought, than to haue read or heard ought of the ſame, from the relation of others. <hi>Florus</hi> writeth, <hi>that this country doth lie amid the mountaines. Item,</hi> he calleth it, <hi>a copſy country, full of woods and forreſts.</hi> For he affirmeth that <hi>Curio</hi> came vp as high as <hi>Dacia,</hi> but durſt go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for feare of the dreadfull darke woods. <hi>Strabo</hi> in the ſeuenth booke of his Geographie, and <hi>Virgil</hi> in the third of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orgickes, do ſpeake of the deſerts and wilderneſſes of the Getes. The ſame authour calleth it, <hi>Gentem indomitam,</hi> an vnruelie nation. <hi>Statius</hi> ſaith, that they are <hi>hirſuti,</hi> hairie, <hi>intonſi,</hi> vnſhorne, <hi>pelliti,</hi> furred or clad in skins, inhumane, ſturdy, ſtern, <hi>braccati,</hi> wearing long ſide breeches and mantles, like to our Iriſhmen. I read in <hi>Pliny</hi> that they vſed <hi>to paint their faces</hi> [like vnto our Britans.] That there is not a more ſtern nation in the World, <hi>Ouid</hi> the Poet, who did not only ſee the country, but alſo dwelt amongſt them and ſaw their manners, very truly wrote of them. <hi>Vegetius,</hi> who wrote of the Art of warre, ſaith that it is <hi>a very warlike people:</hi> Hauing indeed, as the Prince of Poets teſtifieth, god <hi>Mars for their Lieutenant and Gouernour.</hi> Of <hi>Claudian,</hi> it is named, <hi>Bellipotens,</hi> a mighty nation for warlike men. <hi>Philargyrius,</hi> out of <hi>Aufidius Modeſtus</hi> writeth, that when they go to warre, they will not ſet forward, before they drinking downe a certaine meaſure of the waters of the riuer <hi>Iſter (Donaw)</hi> in the maner of hallowed wine, do ſweare that they would neuer returne home againe into their owne country, vntill they had ſlaine their enemies. Whereupon <hi>Virgil</hi> called this riuer <hi>Iſtrum Coniuratum,</hi> coniured <hi>Donaw. Trogus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that this nation, with their king <hi>Orotes,</hi> (another copy hath <hi>Olores:</hi> in <hi>Dion</hi> I read, <hi>Roles</hi>) did fight againſt the Baſtarnae, with very ill ſucceſſe: in reuenge of which cowardiſe, they were by their king enioined, when they go to bed, to lie at the beds feet: or to do thoſe ſeruices to their wiues, which they were wont to do for them. They were in times paſt ſo ſtrong, as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, that they were able to make an army of 200000. men. Of them alſo peraduenture this ſpeech of <hi>Silius Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> is to be vnderſtood: <hi>At gente in Scythica ſuffixa cadauera truncis, Lenta dies ſepelit putri liquentia tabo.</hi> Ioſephus in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke againſt <hi>Appian</hi> writeth there are a certaine kind of Dakes commonly called <hi>Pliſti,</hi> whoſe manner of life he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth to the courſe of life of the <hi>Eſſenes.</hi> Theſe I do verily beleeue are the ſame with thoſe which <hi>Strabo</hi> calleth <hi>Pliſtae</hi> and were of the ſtocke of the <hi>Abij.</hi> And thus much of <hi>Dacia,</hi> now the <hi>Moeſi</hi> do follow, who, as <hi>Dion Pruſaeus</hi> noteth out of <hi>Homer,</hi> were ſometime named <hi>Myſi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the name of MOESIA was all that country vulgarly called, which the riuer <hi>Saw (Sauus)</hi> falling into <hi>Donaw,</hi> aboue <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Thracia,</hi> doth diuide from <hi>Pannonia.</hi> In the which <hi>Moeſia,</hi> beſide diuers other nations, there do inhabit thoſe which anciently were named the <hi>Triballi,</hi> and thoſe which now are called <hi>Dardani.</hi> Theſe are the wordes of <hi>Dion Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeus.</hi> It is by <hi>Ptolemey</hi> encloſed and bounded with the ſame limits. <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo doth extend the coaſts of it from the meeting of the riuer <hi>Saw</hi> with <hi>Donaw,</hi> euen vnto <hi>Pontus (Mar maiore)</hi> Eaſtward: and <hi>Iornandes</hi> maketh it to reach as farre as <hi>Hiſtria,</hi> Weſtward. We haue ſaid before, that MOESIA was ſometime called DACIA: for proofe whereof I could alledge <hi>Flauius Vopiſcus:</hi> who writeth that <hi>Aurelianus</hi> the Emperour, borne heere, did bring certaine people out of <hi>Dacia,</hi> and placed them in MOESIA and to haue named it DACIA AVRELIANA, after his owne name, which is now that prouince that diuideth

Of the people heere, brought from other places, <hi>Strabo</hi> likewiſe writeth, that in his time (who we know liued in the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi>) by <hi>AElius Catus</hi> (or rather, as the learned and induſtrious <hi>Cauſabon</hi> out of <hi>Dion</hi> would haue vs read, <hi>Licinius Craſſus:</hi>) were conueighed of the Getes which dwelt eyond the <hi>Donaw (Iſter)</hi> into <hi>Thracia,</hi> more than 50000. men, and were afterward called MYSI, <hi>Myſians.</hi> An inſcription of an ancient ſtone, mentioned in <hi>Smetius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>AElius Plautius</hi> propraetor of <hi>Moeſia,</hi> did tranſport into this country, of the people and nations beyond the <hi>Donaw,</hi> more than 10000. men, together with their wiues, children, nobles, princes and kings.

Theſe countries are very fertile of all maner of fruites and commodities, ſo that, as <hi>Solinus</hi> witneſſeth, the Romanes commonly called it <hi>Cereris horreum, Ceres</hi> barne.

Of the <hi>Triballi,</hi> a people of this country take this of <hi>Pliny</hi> as he alleadgeth it out of <hi>Iſigonus.</hi> They do bewitch and kill with their eies ſuch as they do ſtedfaſtly looke vpon, any long time together; eſpecially if they be angrie: which miſchiefe of theirs, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are moſt ſubiect vnto, and ſooneſt hurt by. But that is moſt notable and worth the obſeruation, that in ech eie they haue two ſights apeece. He that deſireth to read more of this country, eſpecially of the Lower <hi>Moeſia,</hi> let him repaire to <hi>Ouids</hi> 3. booke <hi>de Ponto,</hi> at the 1. 4. and 10. Elegies.

That <hi>Iſter</hi> or <hi>Donaw,</hi> of all the riuers of the Romane Empire, for greatneſſe is next vnto <hi>Nilus,</hi> we do read in the fragments of <hi>Saluſt. Gyraldus</hi> in his <hi>Syntagmata Deorum,</hi> affirmeth, that the kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> were wont to reſerue certaine of the water of <hi>Donaw</hi> or <hi>Iſter,</hi> in ther treaſuries amongſt their pretious iewels. <hi>Caeſarius, Nazianzenus</hi> brother, in his dialogues ſaith, that this is one of the riuers of Paradiſe: and to be that which the holy Scripture calleth <hi>Phiſon:</hi> which I will eaſily grant him to be true, when he ſhall perſwade me, that by Paradiſe is meant the whole world or maſſie globe of this lower element of the earth: which I do verily beleeue he thought to be true. <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the ſixth booke of his naturall Philoſophy, ſaith, that this <hi>Donaw</hi> doth part <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> Notwithſtanding all writers generally both Latines and Greekes, aſwell ancient as thoſe of later times do attribute this to the riuer <hi>Done (Tanais.)</hi> And what is he, I pray you, that euer dreamed that <hi>Germany</hi> which is beyond this riuer ſhould be a country of <hi>Aſia?</hi> Shall we correct the copy? Or ſhall we retaine that reading in <hi>Horace,</hi> vpon the credit and perill of <hi>Acron</hi> his expoſitour? where he ſaith, that <hi>Tanais</hi> is alſo called <hi>Danubius.</hi> I leaue it to the cenſure of the learned. (This we know for a certainty aſwell <hi>Tanais</hi> as <hi>Danubius,</hi> is of the inhabitants neere about, called <hi>Done:</hi> and ſurely I thinke that both the Greeke <hi>Tanais,</hi> as the Latine <hi>Danubius,</hi> were made of the barbarous <hi>Done</hi> or <hi>Tane;</hi> which in that language peraduenture for ought I know, may ſignifie a riuer or ſtreame: ſo <hi>Nilas,</hi> as <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> ſeemeth to affirme tooke his name of <hi>Nuchul,</hi> which generally ſignifieth a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as all men meanly skild in Hebrew or Arabicke can teſtifie with him.) <hi>Iſidore</hi> alſo in the ninth chapter of the ſeuenteenth booke of his <hi>Origines,</hi> ſeemeth to be of this opinion, where he writeth that <hi>Rhabarbarum,</hi> rhew barbe, groweth in <hi>ſolo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico,</hi> in a barbarous country, beyond the <hi>Donaw:</hi> For we know at this day, that it groweth neere the riuer <hi>Rha,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Donaw</hi> Eaſtward. In <hi>Pliny</hi> we read that euery one of his mouthes, whereby it emptieth it ſelfe into the ſea, are ſo wide and great, that it is affirmed to ouercome the ſea for forty miles in length together, and that ſo farre the waters may be perceiued to be ſweet amid the brackiſh ſurges of the ſalt ſea. <hi>Polybius</hi> in his fourth booke to theſe adioineth, that by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſwift fall of the waters of this riuer into <hi>Pontus (Mar maiore)</hi> there are certaine knols, hils, or ſhelfs, which the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call <hi>Stethe,</hi> that is, breaſt bones, made of the gathering together of ſuch things as the riuer bringeth downe with it, and are more than a day ſaile off from land, vpon which oft times the ſeamen falling by negligence, are in great danger of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke. <hi>Strabo</hi> alſo maketh mention of the ſame. They which deſire to know more of this riuer, his name, nature, quality, fountaine, mouthes, and ſtreames which do runne into it, let him read the commentaries of <hi>William Stuckius</hi> written vpon <hi>Arrianus Periplus</hi> of the Euxine ſea: for there he hath moſt plentifully and learnedly deſcr bed all theſe things. Of the Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Moeſians, Getes, Dakes and other countries, nations and people of this mappe, read the ſeuenth booke of <hi>Straboes</hi> Geography, and the Epitome of the ſame.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſea which heere we purpoſe to deſcribe (famouſed of ancient writers by meanes of the <hi>Argonantes</hi> and fabulous ſtory of <hi>the golden fleece</hi>) was called, as we find recorded, by diuers and ſundrie names: firſt it was called PONTVS by the figure <hi>Synecdoche;</hi> then PONTVS AXENVS, that is, <hi>inhoſpitale,</hi> the harbourleſſe ſea, but afterward it was named PONTVS EVXINVS, <hi>hoſpitale mare,</hi> the good harborough, as <hi>Pliny, Ouid</hi> and others do witneſſe. <hi>Strabo, Tacitus, Plutarch, Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey</hi> and <hi>Iornandes</hi> do call it PONTICVM <hi>mare,</hi> the Ponticke ſea, without any addition at all. <hi>Lucretius</hi> nameth it PONTI <hi>mare,</hi> the ſea of <hi>Pontus,</hi> of the country <hi>Pontus</hi> abuttant vpon it. For the ſame reaſon it is, of <hi>Valerius Flaccus, Ouid</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> named SARMATICVM and SCYTHICVM <hi>mare,</hi> the Sarmatian and Scythian ſea; of <hi>Claudian</hi> AMAZONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VM: of <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Oroſius,</hi> CIMMERIVM: of <hi>Feſtus Auienus,</hi> TAVRICVM: of the <hi>Sarmatians, Scythians, Amazones, Cimmerians</hi> and <hi>Tauri,</hi> certaine Nations dwelling vpon the coaſt of this ſea. Of the prouince <hi>Colchis,</hi> neighbour vnto it vpon the Eaſt, <hi>Strabo</hi> nameth it COLCHICVM <hi>mare,</hi> of the mountaine <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> which heere beginneth: <hi>Apollonius</hi> intituleth it CAVCASEVM: of the riuer <hi>Phaſis,</hi> which vnloadeth it ſelfe into this ſea, (or towne of that name ſituate vpon that riuer) <hi>Ariſtides</hi> calleth it PHASIANVM <hi>mare. Procopius</hi> ſaith that it was ſometime named <hi>Tanais,</hi> vnfitly and falſly, as I thinke. Almoſt all ancient writers haue likened this ſea (or more truly, this bay or gulfe) vnto a Scythian bow when it is bent: ſo that the ſtring doth repreſent the South part of it: namely from the ſtreights of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> vnto the further end of it Eaſtward, toward the riuer <hi>Phaſis:</hi> for excepting only the promontory <hi>Carambis, (Cabo Piſello)</hi> all the reſt of this ſhore hath ſuch ſmall capes and creekes, that it is not much vnlike to a right line. The other ſide or North part doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble an horne that hath two crooked ends, the vpper end more round: the lower more ſtraight: which proportion this our mappe doth very preciſely expreſſe. This ſea alſo hath two promontories; one in the South, then called <hi>Promontorium Carambis,</hi> now <hi>Cabo Piſello:</hi> the other in the North, <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey</hi> nameth it <hi>Criou metopon, Arietis frons,</hi> the rammes head: <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> calleth it <hi>Acroma,</hi> and now it is knowen by the name <hi>Famar.</hi> Theſe two capes are oppoſite one againſt the other, and are diſtant one from another about 2500. furlongs, as <hi>Ammianus</hi> and <hi>Euſtathius</hi> do teſtifie: which although they do make 312. Italian miles, yet they are diſtant only 170. miles, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith: or as <hi>Strabo</hi> reporteth, ſo much as a ſhip will ſaile in three daies: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to thoſe, which do ſaile either from the Eaſt to Weſt, or from Weſt to Eaſt, they ſeeme to be ſo neere one to the other, that one would thinke that there were the end of the ſea, and that <hi>Pontus Euxinus</hi> were two ſeas: but when you ſhall come in the middeſt between theſe two capes, then the other part appeareth, as it were a ſecond or another ſea. The compaſſe of it round about by the ſhore <hi>Strabo</hi> maketh to be 25000. furlongs: <hi>Polybius</hi> but 22000. and yet from this <hi>Ammianus</hi> taketh 2000. and that by the authority of <hi>Eratoſthenes, Hecataeus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> as there he affirmeth. <hi>Herodotus</hi> an eie-witneſſe of the ſame, writeth that he meaſured the length of it and found it to be 11100. furlongs: and likewiſe he found the breadth of it (where it was furtheſt ouer) to be 320. furlongs. This meaſure <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> in the twelfth chapter of his fourth booke, do more diſtinctly, partly out of their owne and partly out of other mens opinions, ſet downe. <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth that about 40. riuers do vnloade themſelues into it. Yet this our mappe doth ſhew many more. Antiquity doth hold that this ſea, of all our ſeas, was by farre the greateſt; (heere hence I ſuppoſe that the Italians haue giuen it that name of <hi>Mar maiore,</hi> the Great ſea) and that heere (as there at <hi>Caliz,</hi> without the ſtraits of <hi>Gibraltar</hi>) was the end of the World: and that it was innaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, both for the huge greatneſſe of it, as alſo by reaſon of the barbarous nations which daily did annoy the ſhore, and vſe all maner of cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity toward ſtrangers and aliens. From hence aroſe thoſe epithites and adiuncts giuen by the ancient poets to this ſea of <hi>Pontus; vaſt and rough, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi> call it: <hi>Ouid, infinite</hi> and <hi>terrible: Lucane, a deuouring</hi> and <hi>dangerous ſea; Silius, raging: Statius, an vncertaine</hi> and <hi>ſwelling ſea: Valerius Flaccus, perilous: Manilius, horrible, ſpitefull</hi> and <hi>furious: Seneca, mad</hi> and <hi>churliſh: Feſtus Auienus, rauciſonum,</hi> making a hoarſe ill fauoured noiſe. Thus farre of the Names, Forme and bigneſſe of this ſea: of the Situation and Nature of the ſame, although <hi>Herodotus, Pomponius, Strabo, Pliny, Ouid</hi> and <hi>Macrobius</hi> (that I may ſay nothing of others) haue ſpoken much, yet in mine opinion, no man hath done it more exactly and diligently than <hi>Ammianus</hi> in his 22. booke; whom he that liſteth, may adioine to this our diſcourſe: and if he be not ſatisfied with theſe, he may to them adde a whole booke, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Arrianus</hi> of this ſea: together with the large commentaries, of <hi>Struckius,</hi> vpon the ſame. As for vs we will content our ſelues in this place with a few peculiar obſeruations of this ſea, gleaned heere and there out of the ancient monuments of learned writers of former ages. <hi>It is ſweet,</hi> or at leaſtwiſe more ſweet than other ſeas: moreouer, <hi>the waters of it are more light than others; and do neuer ebbe and flow,</hi> but alwaies keep one and the ſame ſtint of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one way, as <hi>Lucrece, Macrobius, Pliny</hi> and <hi>Ouid</hi> do witneſſe. Which I take to be the cauſe that ſometime it hath all been frozen ouer. For this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I haue read, in <hi>Ouid, Marcell. Comit.</hi> and others, ſometime to haue happened. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Problemes writeth, <hi>That it is whiter than other ſeas:</hi> (yet the Greekes now call it <hi>Maurothalaſſa,</hi> and likewiſe the Turkes <hi>Caradenis,</hi> that is, as <hi>Lucian</hi> doth interpret them both, <hi>Mare nigrum,</hi> the Blacke ſea. Contrariwiſe <hi>mare Aegeum,</hi> the Archipelago, or Mediterran ſea, the Turkes call <hi>Acdeniz,</hi> and the vulgar Greekes <hi>Aſpra thalaſſa,</hi> both ſignifying as the learned <hi>Leunclaw</hi> expoundeth them, <hi>Mare album,</hi> the white ſea.) <hi>Aelianus</hi> in his <hi>Varia hiſtoria</hi> writeth, <hi>That it breedeth no tender or ſoft ſhelfiſh,</hi> but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldome and thoſe very few. <hi>It feedeth no Whales,</hi> only certaine ſmall ſeales, and pretty little dolphins ſometimes are heere taken, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Morals</hi> hath left recorded. <hi>There is no rauenous creature that praieth vpon fiſh doth liue in it,</hi> beſide ſeales and dolphines, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth. <hi>Strabo</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth booke of his Geography ſaith, <hi>That there are about</hi> 40. <hi>riuers,</hi> which comming from diuers quarters do vnload themſelues into it. Yet we, in this our Mappe, do point at a great many more beſide. The cities, vpon the coaſt of this ſea, more famous, are BYZANTIVM, <hi>(Conſtantinople)</hi> of which we will ſay nothing in this place, becauſe we haue before in the mappe of <hi>Thrace</hi> written of it at large, in reſpect of the narrowneſſe of the place which is aſſigned for ſuch like purpoſes. Then TOMOS (<hi>Tomiſuar,</hi> as <hi>Calcagninus;</hi> or <hi>Kiouia,</hi> as <hi>Ciofánus</hi> thinketh) famous by the baniſhment and exile of the noble poet <hi>Ouid.</hi> BORYSTHENES, otherwiſe called <hi>Olbia</hi> and <hi>Miletopolis, (Strapenor,</hi> a city in <hi>Sarmatia Europaea,</hi> ſituate at the mouth of the riuer <hi>Bori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi>) of which <hi>Dion Pruſaeus</hi> hath ſpoken much (that I may omit others) in his 16. oration. DIOSCVRIAS, which was alſo called <hi>Sebaſtopolis,</hi> built, if you will giue any credit to poeticall fables, by the waggoners of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux:</hi> it is yet to this day knowen by the name of <hi>Sauatopoli</hi> or <hi>Sauaſtopoli.</hi> This city was in times paſt ſo famous, as <hi>Pliny</hi> telleth out of <hi>Timoſthenes,</hi> that there ordinarily reſorted vnto it 300. ſeuerall nations, ſpeaking ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent languages: ſo that the Romanes for the diſpatch of all matters for their ſtate, did maintaine there 130. interpretours. There are heere many other cities, which were nothing ſo renowmed, as TRAPEZVS (now vulgarly called TREBIZONDA: of the Turkes, <hi>Tarabaſſon:</hi> but of the barbarous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neere adioining, as <hi>Theuet</hi> reporteth, <hi>Waccamah:</hi> CERASVS (<hi>Cheraſoda,</hi> or as the barbarous people call it, <hi>Omidie</hi>) PHARNACEA <hi>(Platena)</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISVS (<hi>Amid</hi> or <hi>Hemid,</hi> or as <hi>Niger</hi> thinketh <hi>Simiſo</hi>) SINOPE (<hi>Pordapas,</hi> yet the Turkes to this day call it <hi>Sinabe</hi>) HERACLEA (<hi>Aupop,</hi> and <hi>Penda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachia</hi>) and oueragainſt <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where we began, is CHALCEDON (<hi>Chalcidona,</hi> or as the Turkes terme it, <hi>Caltitiu</hi>) a free city and of great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in thoſe daies, but now as <hi>P. Gyllius</hi> ſaith, it is a ſmall ſtreet without any mention of wals. Vpon the Weſt ſide of this ſea, the Thracians did dwell: vpon the South the Aſians: as the <hi>Bithynians, Galatians</hi> and <hi>Cappadocians.</hi> The <hi>Colchi</hi> did poſſeſſe the Eaſtern coaſt. All along generally vpon the North aſwell in <hi>Europe</hi> as <hi>Aſia,</hi> inhabited the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> and <hi>Scythians,</hi> diſtinguiſhed into diuers and ſundry nations: amongſt theſe are the <hi>Tauroſcythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> (which tooke their name from thence) and their <hi>Cherronneſus,</hi> or demy-ile, vulgarly knowen by the name of <hi>Taurica Cherronneſus,</hi> and <hi>Scythica Cherronneſus. Appianus</hi> nameth it <hi>Pontica Cherronneſus,</hi> the demy-ile of <hi>Pontus:</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, was ſometime inuironed round with the ſea. For forme and quality it is compared and thought to be much like <hi>Peloponneſus. Strabo,</hi> from the mouth or relation of others, hath left written, that it was ſometime annexed to the maine land by an <hi>iſthmos,</hi> or neckeland of 360. furlongs in length. The country toward <hi>Metopon (Frons Arietis</hi> the rammes head) is rough, mountainous and much ſubiect to Northren ſtormes, cold and violent blaſts. Neere to <hi>Theodoſia, (Caffa</hi> or <hi>Cofe,</hi> as the Turkes write it: a city ſituate vpon the ſea, whoſe hauen is ſo capacious and large, that it is able to entertaine an hundred tall ſhippes at once) it is a good and fertile ſoile. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> writeth that <hi>bulbi,</hi> certaine bolled rootes, which do grow heere of their owne accord, are ſo ſweet and pleaſant that they may be eaten raw. In it alſo is the hill <hi>Beroſus,</hi> where, as <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth, are three wels, of which, whoſoeuer drinketh, he dieth without any griefe and without any remedy. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Tanais,</hi> maketh mention of an oile made in this mountaine <hi>Beroſus,</hi> which the country people do preſſe out of a certaine plant which they call <hi>Halinda.</hi> With this oile they annoint themſelues, and then being once warme they feele not the cold although it be neuer ſo bitter. The ſame authour telleth of the hearb <hi>Phryxa,</hi> which groweth about <hi>Borea antrum,</hi> the caue <hi>Borea,</hi> which if the ſtepchildren ſhall haue about them, they ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no wrong at their ſtepmothers hand. This hearb is colder than Snow: yet as ſoone as euer the ſtepmothers ſhall go about to wrong their ſonne in lawes, it preſently caſteth out flames of fire: and by that meanes they ſhunne all eminent dangers and cauſes of feare. Thus far of <hi>Cherronneſus Taurica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They which take any pleaſure in fables or fictions of poets belonging to this <hi>Pontus</hi> or ſpoken of the ſame, let them haue recourſe to <hi>Senecan Medra,</hi> or the <hi>Iphigenia</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> and others that haue written of the voiages of the <hi>Argonautes,</hi> or the ſtory of <hi>Iaſons Golden fleece.</hi> But before I leaue this ſea I thinke it not amiſſe to put thee in mind what <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth in the 11. chapter of his 9. booke of the Antiquity of the Iewes. Hee there ſaith that <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet being deuoured and ſwallowed vp of the whale about <hi>Iſſicus finus (Golfo de Atazzo,</hi> a bay of the mediterran ſea, neere to <hi>Iſſus,</hi> a city of <hi>Sili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> which now they vulgarly call <hi>Atazzo</hi>) was after three daies caſt vp againe, into this Euxine ſea, aliue vnhurt or any way periſhed. One part of this his relation I will beleeue, if you will beleeue the other. <hi>Robertus Conſtantinus</hi> in his ſupplement of the Latine tongue ſaith, that <hi>Lamia</hi> was a fiſh. Of the fenne MAEOTIS, (<hi>Mar delle Sabacche,</hi> it is commonly called now a daies: the Italians, of a towne abuttant vpon it, name it <hi>Mar della Tana,</hi> and <hi>Mar bianco,</hi> the white ſea: of the Scythians it is called <hi>Carpaluc:</hi> of the Arabians <hi>Bohari'lazach,</hi> as <hi>Baptiſta Ramuſius</hi> witneſſeth) beſide other Geographers, read <hi>Polyb.</hi> in his 4. booke, and <hi>Ariſt.</hi> in the end of his 1. booke, and beginning of the 2. of his <hi>Meteor.</hi> The length of it is 6000. as <hi>Themiſtius Euphrada</hi> writeth. In this ſea there are not many ilands, yet theſe are not all inhabited or manured; and the people which dwell in them do liue very poorly: for they vſe the fleſh of great fiſhes, dried in the ſunne, and then beaten and ſtamped to powder, in ſteed or meale for bread: for as <hi>Pomponeus</hi> ſaith, they yeeld no great ſtore of prouiſion for victuals.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nder the name of <hi>THRACIA</hi> many and diuerſe countries with ſundry people are comprehended: for except the Indies it is the greateſt country of the world as <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth teſtifie: for <hi>Pliny</hi> doth confine it by the riuer <hi>Iſter, Pontus, Propon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the Aegean ſea, and the riuer <hi>Strymon.</hi> Yea and <hi>Strabo</hi> in the firſt booke of his Geography, according to the opinion of <hi>Homer,</hi> extendeth it as farre that way as the riuer <hi>Peneus,</hi> which riuer <hi>Ptolemey</hi> attributeth to <hi>Macedonia. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi> maketh the Scordiſci to be a people of this country. <hi>Appianus</hi> to theſe conioineth the Illyrians. So alſo doth <hi>Mela</hi> vpon the Weſt, who moreouer vpon the South to it doth aſſigne the mount <hi>Athos.</hi> Many of the ancient writers likewiſe doe make the peninſula or demy-iland <hi>Pallene,</hi> a portion belonging to this country. Yea if one may credit <hi>Eratoſthenes,</hi> the hill <hi>Olympus</hi> doth part <hi>Macedonia</hi> from <hi>Thrace.</hi> And the Epitome of <hi>Strabo</hi> in his ſeuenth booke maketh yet a farre other deſcription of the bounds of this region. (For in <hi>Strabo</hi> himſelfe the deſcription of <hi>Thracia</hi> is wholly miſſing.) This Epitome, I ſay, ſeuereth <hi>Thrace</hi> from <hi>Macedony</hi> by the mouth of the riuer <hi>Neſſus.</hi> Yea and indeed in ſuccedent ages the compaſſe of this country was not much leſſe: for <hi>Ammianus, Procopius, Sextus Rufus,</hi> and the booke of Records <hi>(Notiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum)</hi> do diuide it into theſe ſixe ſhires or prouinces; <hi>Moeſia,</hi> the Second or Lower, <hi>Scythia, Europa,</hi> (peculiarly calling this part by the generall name of that quarter of the world wherein the whole did ſtand) <hi>Rhodopa, Haemimontus,</hi> and <hi>Thracia,</hi> properly and ſpecially ſo called. Heere hence it is that in <hi>Trebellius</hi> and <hi>Oroſius;</hi> there is mention made of the <hi>THRACIA'S,</hi> in the plurall number. Yet this our Mappe is not ſo farre extended toward the North. For we haue indeed followed the deſcription of <hi>Ptolemey</hi> in butting and bounding it; who ſeuereth it from other Northren countries by the mount <hi>Haemus.</hi> And this true <hi>THRACIA</hi> we do thinke to haue beene ſo named of the inchanting Nymph <hi>Thraca,</hi> as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> out of <hi>Athenaeus</hi> teacheth vs; hauing been in former times called <hi>PERCA:</hi> And had beene alſo ſometime, as many do verily thinke, knowne by the names of <hi>ARIA, ODRYSA, CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONIA</hi> and <hi>SCYTONIA. Ioſephus</hi> a moſt graue authour affirmeth, that it was of the Iewes called <hi>THYRAS.</hi> The abouenamed <hi>Ptolemey</hi> in it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth theſe foureteene ſhires, <hi>Dantheletica, Sardica, Vſdicefica, Selletica, Moedica, Droſica, Coeletica, Sapaica, Corpialica, Coenica, Beſſica, Bennica, Samaica,</hi> and <hi>Vrbana. Plinie</hi> diuideth it into fifty (or two and fifty, as I remember <hi>Dalechampius</hi> hath) Regiments, <hi>(Strategiae)</hi> ſhirewickes, I thinke, they call them in ſome places of <hi>England,</hi> Hundreds, or Wapentakes I would call them. This <hi>Thracia,</hi> properly ſo called, <hi>Ammianus</hi> likeneth vnto the halfe Moone: or, to a Theater, whoſe higher part is encloſed with high and ſteep mountaines, which do diuide this ſame country from <hi>Dacia;</hi> The lower part openeth toward the Aegean ſea.</p>
            <p>Of the nature and quality of this country, <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaketh on this manner: <hi>Terra procul vaſtis colitur Mauortia campis:</hi> A martiall country li'th farre off, vaſt champions it conteinth: <hi>Plutarch</hi> teacheth vs that it hath in it many huge fennes and bogges, and that it is diuided or croſſed this way and that way by diuerſe deep and dangerous riuers. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith that the ſoile of <hi>Thracia</hi> is very fertile for all manner of corne, and commendeth the wheat of the ſame, for waight and heauineſſe: <hi>Item,</hi> for goodneſſe he affirmeth that this kinde of wheat poſſeſſeth the third place. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> teſtifieth that it beareth ſome vines, eſpecially about <hi>Biblina,</hi> which otherwiſe is called <hi>Oeſyma. Item, Pliny</hi> highly commendeth <hi>Vinum Maroneum,</hi> the wine of <hi>Marogna,</hi> or <hi>Marolia,</hi> as <hi>Lewnclawe</hi> calleth it. <hi>Homer</hi> alſo affirmeth, that the Achiui were wont, by ſhippe to tranſport wines from <hi>Thace</hi> into <hi>Grecce. Xenophon</hi> writeth, that in the mount <hi>Pangeus,</hi> there is a gold-mine: and <hi>Strabo</hi> affirmeth the like to be about <hi>Philippi.</hi> Heere alſo is the <hi>Thracian ſtone,</hi> which is kindled by the water, and quenched with oile, as <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth. But becauſe no man of all the ancient writers, hath better deſcribed this countrie than <hi>Pomponius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> let vs heere him ſpeake: It is, ſaith he, a countrie that cannot much bragge either of the goodneſſe of their ſoile, or wholeſomeneſſe of their aire: nay indeed, except it be in ſome place neere the ſea coaſt, it is barren, cold, and verie vnkinde to all things generally that are ſet, ſowne, or laid into the ſame. It ſeldome beareth any apple-trees or other fruit-trees: yet vines do heere and there grow in diuers places: but the grapes neuer ripen kindly, or come to any perfection, except in ſome places where the vine-dreſſers do, by the leaues, keepe the cold from them. It is a countrey much more kinde to men: yet they are none of the propereſt: for they are very clowniſh, vnhandſome and rough hewed fellowes: but otherwiſe for number and hardineſſe (for they are many and thoſe very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill) this nation farre ſurpaſſeth others neere adioining. This latter alſo is auerred by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> who affirmeth it to containe ſuch wonderfull multitudes of men, that, if you ſhall except <hi>France (Gallia)</hi> it may for ought that I know, in all likely-hood, for multitude of men be preferred before any countrie in the world. <hi>Item, Herodotus</hi> ſaith, that next after the Indies, it is the greateſt countrey of the whole earth. <hi>Liuy</hi> calleth it a deſperate and moſt fierce Nation: and <hi>Solinus</hi> he ſaith, that they are a verie ſtout and hardy people: <hi>Sextus Rufus</hi> maketh them the moſt cruell and furious people that euer he ſaw or heard of: which <hi>Florus</hi> well expreſſeth by this example, when he writeth that certaine of them being taken by the Romanes, and giued as the manner of captiiſes is, did bite the fetters and manacles with their teeth, and ſo themſelues to haue ſufficiently puniſhed their owne barbarous cruelty: and that there are of their parents euen from their cradle trained vp to this wild inhumane kinde of life, <hi>Sidonius</hi> doth teach vs in theſe words: <hi>Excipit hic natos glacies, &amp; matris ab aluo Artus infantum molles nix cimbrica durat. Pectore vixaliter quiſquam, ſed ab vbere tractus. Plus potat per vulnus equum, ſic lacte relicto, Virtutem gens tota bibit. Creuere parumper, Mox pugnam ludunt iaculis: hos ſuggerit illis. Nutrix plaga iocos: pueri venatibus apti, Luſtra feris vacuant. rapto ditata iuuentus, Iura colit gladij. conſummatámque ſenectam Non ferro finire pudet. Tali ordine vitae Ciues Martis agunt.</hi> So ſoone as infant heere is borne, The thing they ſay is ſure, To froſt and ſnow their tender limmes They preſently inure. Scarce one of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands heere, Doth ſucke the Nurces teate: Warme blood of warlike horſes heere, For moſt part's infants meat: This diet mak'th them bold and hard. And as they come to growth They learne to toſſe the speare and pike: Heere no man liueth in ſlowth. Theſe are the ſports that theſe men vſe: As ſoone as boies can ride The fallow deere they learne to chaſe: &amp;c. But to theſe let vs adde that commendation of them, giuen by the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> in his <hi>Authentica:</hi> That is moſt certaine, ſaith he, and for a truth confeſſed of all men, That if any one do but name the countrie of <hi>Thracia,</hi> by and by together as ſoone as the word is out of his mouth, there preſently entreth into the heart of the ſtander by, a conceit of manhood and warlike valour fit for all manner of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the field. For theſe things naturally bred in the bone, and as it were proper qualities peculiar to this country onely. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the valorous wiſedome <hi>(Animoſam ſapientiam)</hi> of the Thracians. Yet <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſaith it was ſuch, as it was the next doore to barbarous crueltie: whereſoeuer the Thracian is ſecure and thinketh he may ſafely inſult, there he is moſt bloudy and tyrannous. When it thundereth and lightneth, they ſhoote their arrowes vp into the aire, threatning euen God himſelfe, for that indeed they thinke there is no other God but that whom they adore. Theſe gods, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> writeth. <hi>Mars, Bacchus, Diana</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> they worſhip onely and none other. Yet the ſame authour in another place nameth <hi>Pliſtorius,</hi> for a God proper vnto this nation onely. <hi>Ammianus</hi> alſo writeth that theſe people do worſhip the gooddeſſe <hi>Bellona.</hi> To theſe their gods, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> affirmeth, they ſlew and ſacrificed men, before they ſet forward and attempted to daren battell. In which they vſed, by the report of <hi>Liuy,</hi> two hand ſwords of an huge length. Their ſalades or head peeces were of woolues skins, euery man wearing his dart, and his target with a ſhort dagger or poinyard. Euery man heere thinketh it a gallant thing and very honourable to liue by the warres, and by robbing and ſpoiling. An idle fellow heere is accounted for a right honest man: and it is a moſt baſe and contemptible thing to be an huſbandman. <hi>Clemens</hi> in the ſeuenth booke of his <hi>Stromaton</hi> writeth, that theſe people are of complexion and colour lion tawney, and wanne, or as it were of a skie colour. <hi>Homer</hi> calleth them <hi>Comatos Thraces,</hi> Long-locked Thracians: <hi>Iulius Pollux, In vertice crinitos,</hi> wearing a long-locke vpon the crowne of the head. It was accounted for an honourable thing amongst them to haue their faces full of skarres: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith, that it was no diſgrace to any man. Yea and <hi>Plutarch</hi> addeth that they vſed to imprinte markes vpon their wiues faces: which <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> in the twelfth booke of his <hi>Deipnoſophiſton</hi> iuſtifieth to be true. <hi>Heraclides</hi> and <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> do iointly affirme, that euery man vſually had more wiues than one. It is very certaine, that they were great drinkers of wine and ſound drunkerds, and that they brewed their wine with hony, we learne out of <hi>Pliny.</hi> Yet in <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> I read that diuerſe of them did neuer know what wine meant; but when they meant to be merrie, ſitting round about the hearth, certaine ſeedes were ſtrawen vpon the coales, which caſt vp ſuch a ſmoake or ſteame, that it made euery man ſo light-headed and pleaſant, as if he had beene cup ſhot, or had taken a pot or two too much of ſtrongeſt beere or wine that might be drunke. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> alſo writeth that they had heere a kinde of drinke which they called <hi>Brytum,</hi> made of barly and other kinds of corne. <hi>Suidas</hi> writeth, that what wine ſoeuer the pot-companions, in their quaffings and carowſings could not drinke out was preſently powred vpon their heads. The ſame authour reporteth, that they are much delighted to eate garleeke, as being indeeed of it ſelfe very hot, and their country wherein they dwell very bleake and cold. <hi>Iulius Pollux</hi> writeth, that they vſed to exchange ſlaues for ſalt. Whereupon <hi>Sale empti,</hi> bought with ſalt, was ſpoken prouerbially of bad ſeruants and ſuch as were taken vp at iade-faire. <hi>Item,</hi> he affirmeth, that this nation firſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a kinde of muſicall inſtrument called <hi>Canthorum.</hi> But of the manners and behauiour of this people, many other things may be obſerued in the reading of thoſe authours which before I haue cited, eſpecially in <hi>Herodotus, Athenaeus, Solinus, Pomponius Mela,</hi> and <hi>Heraclides</hi> his Policies. Theſe, although meere Barbarians and vnlearned, yet in this one thing, diuerſe of them iudged not amiſſe, in that they thought and verily beleeued the ſoule to be immortall: others did thinke that it did die, yet ſo as that it was in better eſtate then when it liued. Heereupon it is, that they morned when women were brought in bed, and wept at the birth of their children. An ancient writer affirmeth, that there was a kind of nation of the Thracians that could not reckon further then the number of foure, any greater number they could not remember. Now it remaineth that we ſhould, out of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> ſay ſomething of the miracles, and ſtrange things found and obſerued in this countrie. In <hi>Chalcidis,</hi> a prouince heere, there is a place called <hi>Cantharoletron;</hi> for that any beaſt that goeth in thither, may come ſafe and ſound out againe: ſaue only the beaſt called <hi>Cantharus:</hi> theſe neuer come out from thence aliue, but they preſently fall a turning

Between <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium (Conſtantinople)</hi> and the Cherſoneſus, there is an hill which they call <hi>The holy mount,</hi> neere to which, the ſea oftentimes carieth vpon the top of his waters a kinde of ſlimy ſubſtance called of the Latines, <hi>Bitumen.</hi> In <hi>Agria,</hi> a ſhire of this country, the riuer <hi>Pontus,</hi> carieth downe in his channell cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtones much like vnto coales: which being kindled, and water caſt vpon them, they burne the better: but being blowne with bellowes, they go quite out. There is no manner of vermine or venemous creatures that can abide the ſmell of this kinde of ſiring. Amongst the <hi>Cinchropſoſes</hi> there is a fountaine, of whoſe water, whoſoeuer ſhall drinke they die immediately. In <hi>Botiaea,</hi> there groweth a ſtone, which by the heat or reuerberation of the Sunne beames kindleth, and caſteth foorth ſparks and flames of fire. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth, that there is a ſpring not farre from the hill <hi>Pangaeus,</hi> of whoſe waters if one fill one and the ſame veſſell, and then weight it, he ſhall finde it to be twiſe ſo heauy in the winter, as it was in the ſummer. <hi>Plutarch</hi> (whom <hi>Tzetzes</hi> calleth, The yonger: another nameth him <hi>Parthenicus</hi>) reporteth certaine things of the herbe <hi>Cythara,</hi> the ſtones <hi>Panſilypus</hi> and <hi>Philadelphi,</hi> found in the riuers <hi>Ebrus</hi> and <hi>Strymon:</hi> which, becauſe they are more like to fables, than true ſtories, I do in this place willingly omit. To reckon vp heere the ſeuerall Nations, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Riuers or Cities of this country, I thinke it nothing neceſſary: becauſe they are at one view better to be ſeene in the Mappe it ſelfe. Yet of the city <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium</hi> (now <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) for that it is ſooft mentioned in ancient hiſtories, to ſay nothing at all, for that we do in ſome ſort hold it an iniury, I thinke it not amiſſe to write theſe few lines following, of the deſcription of it. The firſt founder of <hi>BYZANTIVM,</hi> which was alſo in times paſt called <hi>LYGOS,</hi> was, as <hi>Trogus</hi> and <hi>Euſtathius</hi> do thinke, one <hi>Pauſanias</hi> a Captaine of the Spartanes: and that, as <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> writeth, at ſuch time as <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> was king of the Romanes. It was ſo called of <hi>Byzantes,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ceroeſſas,</hi> a captaine of the Megareans: whom <hi>Euſtathius</hi> affirmeth, to haue beene the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteſt and moſt iuſt man that euer the earth did beare. This city is ſituate vpon an high cliffe, at the narroweſt place of <hi>Boſphorus, Thracius</hi> (the frith or ſtreights of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) in a very fertile ſoile, and vpon a fruitfull and commodious ſea <hi>(fertili ſolo &amp; foecundo ſalo)</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> writeth. In reſpect of which ſituation, being ſtrongly fortified by nature, it is thought to be almoſt inuincible. Whereupon <hi>Trebellius Pollio</hi> calleth it <hi>clauſtrum Ponticum,</hi> The blocke-houſe of <hi>Pontus. Oroſius</hi> termeth it, <hi>Principem gentium,</hi> the ſoueraigne of all Nations; <hi>Sextus Rufus, Arcem ſecundam Romani orbis,</hi> The ſecond bulwarke or fortreſſe of the Romane Empire: <hi>Procopius, Arcem Europae &amp; Aſiae obicem ponentem,</hi> The Caſtle of <hi>Europe,</hi> and barre against <hi>Aſia: Themiſtocles Euphrada, Magnificentiae officinam,</hi> The ſhop of all manner of brauery and courtlike faſhions: and <hi>Ouid</hi> he calleth it, <hi>Vaſtam gemini maris ianuam,</hi> The huge gate of the two ſeas, to wit, <hi>Propontis (Mar di marmora)</hi> and <hi>Pontus Euxinus (Mar maiore.)</hi> For the rampart and wals of it (which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> and both the <hi>Dions</hi> ſo highly commend) were ſo ſtrong that the Athenians vſed in former times, as the ſame <hi>Euſtathius</hi> writeth, to cary all their goods and treaſure thither and there to beſtow it, holding it to be a place impregnable and not to be ſurprized by any enemy whatſoeuer. Of the great felicity of this city you may read many things worth the obſeruation in diuerſe ancient writers; eſpecially in <hi>Polybius, Herodian, Xiphiline, Dion Pruſens,</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles Euphrada</hi> in his ſixth oration: who deemeth the citizens thereof to be moſt happie men, both for the goodly riuer which paſſeth by it, temperature of the aire, fertility of the ſoile wherein it ſtandeth, capacious hauen and creeke of the ſea, gorgeous church and ſtately wals of the ſame. Heerupon grew that daintineſſe, luxury, drunkenneſſe and wantonneſſe of theſe people: which vices of theirs are noted by <hi>Athenaeus</hi> in the tenth booke of his <hi>Deipnoſophiſton:</hi> and <hi>Aelianus</hi> in the foureteenth chapter of the third booke of his <hi>varia hiſtoria.</hi> This city, fortune often frowning vpon it, was ſometimes poſſeſſed of the Spartans or Lacedemonians: after that it was vnder the command of the Athenians. Then ſhaking off their yoke, it began by a little and a little to chalenge vnto it ſelfe a kinde of ſoueraignty and freedome from any forren iuriſdiction: which it held for a while, vntill <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Romane Emperour, ſubdued it, and reduced it vnto the forme of a prouince. While it thus ſtoode vnder the command of the Romanes, it was, by <hi>Septimius Seuerus,</hi> who held on <hi>Nigers</hi> ſide, aſſaulted, battered, raced to the ground, and of a goodly flouriſhing city, made a poore and beggerly village, and withall was adiudged to belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Perinthij.</hi> But <hi>Antonius Caracalla, Seuerus</hi> his ſonne, reſtored them to their ancient liberties, and was called by the name of <hi>ANTONIA,</hi> as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtathius</hi> teſtifieth. Yet for <hi>Antonia</hi> (that I may note this by the way) an ancient braſſe coine, of the Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> which I haue, doth teach vs that it ought to be read <hi>Antoninia.</hi> For vpon this peece of money was ſtamped <hi>ΑΝΤΟΝΕΙΝΙΑ ΒΥΖΑΝΤΙΩΝ ΣΕΒΑΣΤΑ,</hi> that is, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninia the Emperiall city of the Bizantini.</hi> But after this it was againe waſted by <hi>Gallienus</hi> the Emperour, and all the citizens and garriſon ſouldiers thereof ſlaine and put to the ſword. Yet for feare leaſt the Scythians, Getes and other barbarous nations might breake in to the Romane territories on that ſide, it was againe reedified, repaired and fortified by the ſame Emperour. But <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> worthily in deed and name ſurnamed the Great, did yet farre more ſtrongly fortifie it: and adorne it with the moſt goodly temple of <hi>Santa Sophia:</hi> and moreouer gracing it with many ſtately ornaments and curious workes of Architecture which he cauſed to be brought out of <hi>Aſia, Africa, Europe,</hi> yea and from <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, and after his owne name by proclamation cauſed it to be intituled and called by the name of <hi>CONSTANTINOPOLIS,</hi> that is, Conſtantines city. <hi>Item,</hi> he tooke it from the <hi>Perinthij,</hi> made it a free cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration and endowed it with many large and ample priuiledges. After him, as <hi>Themiſtius Euphrada</hi> in his ſixth oration teſtifieth, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great did beautifie it with diuerſe gorgeous and costly buildings. Moreouer <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour, as <hi>Procopius</hi> an eie-witneſſe affirmeth, adorned it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moſt faire and beautifull workes of curious Architecture. But eſpecially he graced it by that glorious worke of that ſtately temple of <hi>Santa Sophia,</hi> which he repaired (being a little before burnt downe, and vtterly defaced by fire) and of it beſtowed ſuch coſt, that the Emperour himſelfe, as <hi>Glycas</hi> witneſſeth, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid that in this edifice he had exceeded euen glorious king <hi>Salomon,</hi> in that his building. Which worke of his, as <hi>P. Diaconus</hi> writeth of it, did ſo much excell all other buildings, that in the whole world beſide there was not to be found another that might in any reſpect be compared vnto it. Whereupon <hi>Corippus</hi> thus ſpeak th of this Church: <hi>Iam Solomoniaci ſileat deſcriptio templi, Cedant cunctorum miracula nota locorum.</hi> That ſtately worke of <hi>Salomon,</hi> great <hi>Iudahs</hi> glorious king, May now be ſtill and bragge no more: The greateſt woonders of the world, may well giue place to this, No eie hath ſeene the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Conſta. Manaſſes</hi> calleth it <hi>Orbis ornamentum,</hi> The glorie of the world, which he verily beleeueth the very Seraphim themſelues did reuerence and adore. But if any one be deſirous to know the faſhion and modell of this building, let him haue recourſe to <hi>Procopius</hi> his firſt booke of <hi>Edifices.</hi> Of this church <hi>Paulus Lyrus Florus</hi> wrote a treatiſe in heroike or hexameter verſe, as <hi>Agathias</hi> in his fifth booke teſtifieth. So that it might ſeeme that there was nothing more that might be wiſhed for the further beautifying of this city. <hi>Sozomen</hi> doubted not boldly to affirme, That <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> both for multitude of men, and ſtore of wealth and money, by all mens ioint conſent, did farre excell euen great <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe. Moreouer <hi>Nazianzen</hi> writeth, That <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for beauty and brauerie, did as much excell all other cities of the world beſide, as the higheſt heauens in glory do exceed the loweſt elements. Whereupon of ſome it was graced with theſe proud titles, <hi>VRBS AETERNAE, VRBS REGIA, NOVA &amp; SECVNDA ROMA, The eternall City, The Emperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all City; New</hi> Rome, and <hi>Another</hi> Rome. In the praiſing and tax of the chiefe cities of the Romane Empire, this city, in a Councell there held, was placed in the ſecond degree: but in former times, as <hi>Egeſippus</hi> teſtifieth, it poſſeſſed only the third place. <hi>Zoſimus</hi> writeth, that there is no other city whatſoeuer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you reſpect the large compaſſe and circuite of the wals, or great felicity of it euery way, that may iuſtly be compared vnto it. The buildings of it are ſo cloſe and neere together and the houſes and ſtreets are ſo peſtered and thronged, that whether a man keepe home or walke abroad he ſhall be ſo crowded and thruſt, that ſcarcely he might go without danger, by reaſon of the huge throng of men and infinite of multitude of cattle alwaies paſſing to and fro in the ſame. He that deſireth to know all the glorious ornaments and woonderfull things worthy of obſeruation to be ſeene in this city, let him read <hi>George Cedren</hi> his hiſtorie of the life of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great. Where he doth not onelie receite them all and reckon them vp curiouſly, but alſo he doth moſt artificially deſcribe them and paint them out in their true colours. This city was taken, in the yeere of Chriſt <hi>1453.</hi> by Mahomet the firſt of that name, Emperour of the Turkes, who at this daie do yet poſſeſſe it. Manie other things pertaining to the beautie and magnificence of this city are to be ſeene in the booke of Records of both the Empires, and in <hi>Procopius</hi> his firſt booke <hi>De Aedificijs.</hi> Of the originall and famous buildings of this city, read <hi>George Codinus:</hi> for no man hath handled that argument better than he. But of the later writers, <hi>Petrus Gyllius</hi> hath moſt exactly and learnedly deſcribed the ſame. Of the Thracians, this one thing in this place I cannot omit; namely, That in former times they bore a great ſway in forren countries, and were great Lords out of their owne natiue ſoile. For they conquered and had vnder them a great part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which is ſituate ouer againſt them, and cauſed it after their name to be called <hi>THRACIA ASIATICA:</hi> yea and toward the South, beyond the bounds of their owne country, vpon the Aegean ſea (where <hi>Pauſanias</hi> deſcribed <hi>THRACIA CARIA</hi>) they had long ſince placed their colonies. This prouince, <hi>Porphyrogenneta</hi> calleth <hi>THRACESIVM. Xenophon</hi> doubted not to call this kingdome the greateſt of all other between the Ionian ſea and <hi>Pontus Euxinus.</hi> Moreouer <hi>Strabo</hi> maketh mention, of a certaine nation, dwelling aboue <hi>Armenia,</hi> which were called <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Seraperae.</hi> To this <hi>Thracia,</hi> is annexed a <hi>Cherſoneſus</hi> or Neckland, which thereupon was ſirnamed <hi>THRACIA CHERSONESVS. Suidas</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <hi>CHERSONESVS HELEESPONTIACA,</hi> of the ſea <hi>Helleſpontus,</hi> neere neighbour vnto it. It is alſo named <hi>PALLENE</hi> of <hi>Halicarnaſſeus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> who moreouer addeth, that it was inhabited of the <hi>Cruſaei. Xenophon</hi> ſaith, it was a moſt rich ſoile, and fertile of all manner of things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: and withall affirmeth that in it were eleuen or twelue great and goodly townes. But wee out of all ancient Hiſtorians haue much exceeded this number, as the Mappe doth ſufficiently approue. This Neckland or <hi>Cherſoneſus</hi> belonged ſometime to <hi>Marcus Agrippa,</hi> after whoſe deceaſe, as <hi>Dion</hi> reporteth, it fell vnto <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi> He that deſireth out of ancient writers, a more ample deſcription of <hi>Thracia,</hi> let him read <hi>Wolfangus Lazius</hi> his Hiſtories of <hi>Greece: Item,</hi> the fifth booke of <hi>Agathias</hi> a Grecian borne. A ſtrange thing it is that <hi>William Bruſſius</hi> writeth of this <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> that by no manner of meanes or diligence vines can be made to grow heere in any great abundance.</p>

            <p>In this country humanity and letters together with the maner to write and read, how to till the ground and ſow corne, was firſt inuented and practiſed, as <hi>Plinius Caecilius</hi> hath left recorded in his epiſtle written to his friend <hi>Maximus:</hi> And this is that country, ſaith he, from whom we had our ſtatutes: that I meane, which receiued not lawes, as thoſe do which are at the command of the conquerour, but willingly and curteouſly did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them, to ſuch as did demand them.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat this iland was ſometimes a part of <hi>Syria</hi> and ioyned to the maine land, <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Naturall history doth affirme: and that it ſhall againe be reunited to the ſame, <hi>Apollo</hi> hath propheſied, as <hi>Strabo</hi> in his Geographie hath left recorded. Amongst thoſe ilands of the Midland ſea more noted for their greatneſſe, this doth poſſeſſe the ſixth place. In reſpect of the forme, it is, as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> writeth, compared to a ſheeps skin: or, as <hi>Hyginus</hi> noteth, to a French target. It is longer one way than another, by the iudgement of <hi>Strabo;</hi> who moreouer addeth, that for excellency and goodneſſe of ſoile, it is inferiour vnto no iland whatſoeuer. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Mela</hi> do teſtifie, hat in former times nine kings did reigne in it at once. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſayth, that king <hi>Amaſis</hi> was of all mortall men the firſt that tooke it, and made it tributary vnto his crowne. It was all ouer ſomtime ſo woody and ouergrowen with buſhes and trees, that the ground by no meanes might be ploughed and manured: a great part of which although it was dayly ſpent in the melting, and refining of copper and ſiluer, (for the iland is very full of mettals) as alſo for the building of ſhips; yet notwithſtanding for all this they neuer were able vtterly to deſtroy their huge woods and infinite luxuriouſneſſe of the ſame, vntill by proclamation free liberty and licence was giuen and granted to euery man that liſt, to fell and cary away what wood and timber they pleaſed: Item, that what ground ſo euer any man had cleared by ſtocking vp the buſhes and trees, that he ſhould for euer after hold for his owne by a free tenure. The woonderfull fertilitie of this ſoile <hi>Elianus</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray, when as he writeth, that ſtagges and hindes do oft times ſwim hither out of <hi>Syria</hi> to fill their bellies: ſo good is the feed of this ile. The manifold variety and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all ſorts of commodities here, thoſe words of <hi>Ammian</hi> in his <hi>14</hi> booke do ſufficiently demonſtrate vnto vs: when he giueth out, That it needeth no maner of forren helpe of other countries, only of it ſelfe it is able to build a ſhippe euen from the very keele to the top ſaile, to rigge it and ſend it foorth to ſea furniſhed with all maner of neceſſaries whatſoeuer. The great riches of this iland, theſe words of <hi>Sextus Rufus</hi> do manifeſtly declare: <hi>CYPRVS famous for great wealth, moued the begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Romans to attempt the ſame; ſo that indeed the intereſt that we haue in that iland, we gat rather by violence, than any right we had vnto it. Florus</hi> writeth, That the riches of this iland when it was once wholly ſubdued did fill the Exchequer of the city of <hi>Rome</hi> more full, than any other conqueſt that euer they got whereſoeuer. <hi>Caryſtius lapis, (Cariſtium,</hi> I thinke a kinde of greene marble) a ſtone of great eſtimation is found here, as <hi>Antigonus</hi> writeth: and as <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the Diamond, Smaragd, Opalus, Cryſtall, Alume, and a kinde of whetſtone, which they call <hi>Naxium.</hi> The ſame authour affirmeth, that the Roſen of this iland doth far ſurpaſſe that of any other places of the whole world. He alſo highly commendeth the oiles and vnguents of the ſame for pleaſure and delight, as alſo their wax and reeds as much for medicines and neceſſary vſe in phyſicke. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> extolleth their paſſing faire doues. Fabulous antiquity did verily beleeue that the goddeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> here firſt came vp out of the ſea: for whoſe honour and memory peraduenture, the women of <hi>Cyprus</hi> (as the ſame authour affirmeth) do offer their bodies to be abuſed of euery man that liſt.

               <p>THis iland is ſeuered by ſo ſmall a frith, (thus <hi>Solinus</hi> deſcribeth it) from the maine land of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> that it is hard to ſay whether it be to be accounted amongst the number of the ilands or not: (Thus ſome haue thought of the <hi>Ile of Wight:</hi>) For on that ſide, which they call <hi>Euripus,</hi> it is ioined to the continent by a faire bridge, and by the meanes of a very ſhort ſcaffold one may paſſe from the firme lana thither on foot: and, as <hi>Procopius</hi> in his <hi>iiij.

Of all the ilands of the Midland ſea this in bigneſſe is held to poſſeſſe the fifth place. In diuers authours it is called by diuers and ſundry names: as <hi>MACRA,</hi> and <hi>MACRIS, ABANTIAS, ASOPIS, OCHE, ELLOPIA, ARCHIBIVM, &amp;c.</hi> Item, <hi>CHALCIS,</hi> of the chiefe and metropolitan city of the ſame, ſituate vpon the forenamed frith. This, I ſay, was the greateſt city and metropolitan of all the whole ile, and was of that power and command, that it ſent forth colonies into <hi>Macedony, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sicilia.</hi> In <hi>Lalantus,</hi> that goodly champion, there are, as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, certaine hot baths, which <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth <hi>Thermas Ellopias,</hi> The baths of Hellopia. They are very ſoueraigne againſt diuers diſeaſes. Here are, as <hi>Strabo</hi> reporteth, the riuers <hi>Cireus</hi> and <hi>Nileus,</hi> of which the one cauſeth ſuch ſheepe as drinke of it to be white, the other blacke. <hi>Pliny</hi> doth alſo highly commend a kinde of greene marble here which they call <hi>Caryſtium,</hi> for that it is digged out of a rocke nere the towne <hi>Caryſtus,</hi> in the Eaſt corner of this ile, where alſo the marble temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> is deſcribed by <hi>Strabo.</hi> Copper was firſt found in this iland: here do growe the woorſt firre trees, as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth; item, here bloweth olympias, a winde proper to this countrey: againe, that the fiſhes taken in the ſea here abouts are ſo ſalt, that you would iudge them taken out of pickle. Of the <hi>Euripus</hi> (where they ſay <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> abode and died) very ſtrange things are tolde by diuers writers; namely that it doth ordinarily ebbe and flowe ſeuen times in a day, and as many times in the night, and that ſo violently and high that no windes can preuaile againſt it, nay and the talleſt ſhips that are, though vnder ſaile, it driueth to and fro as it liſteth. Of all men, <hi>Strabo</hi> in his tenth booke hath moſt curiouſly deſcribed this iland. See alſo what <hi>Procopius</hi> in his fourth booke <hi>de Aedificijs Iuſtiniani,</hi> ſaith of it. Item, <hi>Wolfgangus Lazius,</hi> in that his Hiſtorie of <hi>Greece,</hi> hath ſet out a very large Commentarie of the ſame. <hi>Libanius Sophiſta,</hi> in the life of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> writeth, that it had ſometime two and twentie cities.

               <p>THe braue and franke <hi>RHODVS,</hi> was alſo of the ancient called <hi>OPHIVSA, STADIA, TEICHINE, AETHRAEA, CORYMBA, POEESSA, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TABYRIA,</hi> and <hi>TRINACRIA,</hi> yea and by diuers other names alſo, as thou mayeſt ſee in our Geographicall treaſurie. <hi>Pliny</hi> giueth out that this ile did riſe vp out of the bottome of the ſea, hauing beene before all drowned and couered ouer with water: and <hi>Ammianus</hi> he writeth, that it was ſometime bedrenched and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a golden ſhowre of raine: for the fabulous writers do tell that heere it rained gold, when <hi>Pallas</hi> was borne. Therefore this ſoile, aboue all other was beloued of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the mighty king of gods and men, as the poet ſaith. In <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> we read that it was beloued of the Sun, and made an iland, by the remouing of the water which before had couered it all ouer: for before this it lay hid in the bowels of the ſea, or elſe was ſo full of bogs and fennes that it was altogether inhabitable. In memory of which kindneſſe of louely <hi>Phoebus,</hi> that huge <hi>Coloſſus of the Sun,</hi> one of the ſeuen wonders of the world, was vulgarly ſaid to haue beene erected. This, we read, was made by <hi>Chares Lindius, Lyſippus</hi> his ſcholler, and was at leaſt ſeuenty cubites high: <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaith, that it was one hundred and fiue foot high. This image, ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> within ſix and fifty yeeres after, was by an earth-quake ouerthrowen and laid along: notwithſtanding, as it lay it was a woonderment to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Few men were able to fathom the thombe of it: and the fingers of it were greater than many large ſtatues. Thoſe parts of it that were by any caſualty broken did gape ſo wide, that they were like vnto the mouths of hideous caues: within it were huge maſſie ſtones of great weight, wherewith he ballaced it when it was firſt ſet vp. It was finiſhed in the ſpace of twelue yeeres: and the braſſe thereof waighed three hundred talents. There are beſide in ſundrie other places of this city, an hundred leſſ r coloſſes, yet whereſoeuer any of them were, they did much grace the place. In another place the ſame authour writeth that, that there were in it aboue three thouſand ſtatues. <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth, that this <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> in his time, was by an earth-quake ouerthrowne and lay along, and was broken off at the knees: after which time the Rhodians were by the oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> forbidden to ſet it vp againe. Of this Earth-quake read <hi>Polybius</hi> in his fifth booke. <hi>The aire is neuer ſo thicke and cloudy, nor the heauen euer ſo cloſely maskt,</hi> ſaith Solinus Polyhiſtor, <hi>but the ſunne doth ſhine in Rhodes.</hi> Whereupon Manilius writeth thus of it, <hi>Tuquè verè domus Solis, cui tota ſacrataes.</hi> And thou who truly ſacredart, and princely court of glorious Sunne. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> do commend the <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Figges</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> aboue thoſe of other countries. <hi>Phyloſtratus</hi> in his ſecond booke of Images affirmeth, that the ſoile of this ile is very good and fertile of <hi>Grapes</hi> and <hi>Figges. Euſebius</hi> writeth that the inhabitants and people of this ile, alwaies vpon the ſixth day of <hi>May,</hi> vſed to ſacrifice a man vnto their gods. There are ſome which boldly affirme, that theſe people were called <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> of that famous <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> before mentioned. Amongst which are <hi>Euſtathius, Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Glycas:</hi> as alſo <hi>Suidas,</hi> but that he calleth them not <hi>Coloſſenſes,</hi> but <hi>Colaſſenſes,</hi> ſounding <hi>a,</hi> the firſt vowell, not <hi>o</hi> the fourth, in the ſecond ſyllable. Others, of whoſe opinion I am, do rather thinke, that thoſe are called <hi>Coloſſenſes,</hi> which do inhabite <hi>Coloſtae,</hi> (now <hi>Chone,</hi> as <hi>Porphyrogennetas</hi> ſheweth) a city of <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe, to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle, not to theſe Rhodians, as we haue ſhewed in our Treaſury. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Polybius</hi> do ſpeake much of Rhodes: but of all men <hi>Strabo</hi> doth deſcribe it beſt.

The vines whereof this wine is made do eſpecially grow in the fields of <hi>Aruiſius (Amiſta,</hi> it is now called) about the mount <hi>Pelmaeus.</hi> whereupon this wine was ſince called <hi>Vinum aruiſium,</hi> and by addition of one letter <hi>Maruiſium,</hi> of which later we do commonly call it <hi>Malmeſy.

                  <hi>DELOS</hi> is ſituate amongst the Cyclades. <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, that this ile was farre and neere knowen and talked of by reaſon of the <hi>Temple of Apollo</hi> and the <hi>great market</hi> or faire ordinarily kept there. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> calleth it, <hi>The Mart of all Greece; Feſtus, The greateſt mart of all the world; Thucydides</hi> termeth it, <hi>The Exchequer of Greece;</hi> another nameth it, <hi>The natiue ſoile of the gods:</hi> for the fabulous tales of Poets haue made the world beleeue that <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> were borne here. Of which conceit and opinion of men, it roſe, as <hi>Tully</hi> againſt <hi>Verres</hi> writeth, that this iland was held to be conſecrated vnto them: and ſuch the authority of holineſſe and religion of it both is and alwaies hath beene, that the Perſians making warre vpon <hi>Greece,</hi> in defiance both of God &amp; man, and landing at <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> with a thouſand ſhips, they neuer once offered to profane or once to touch any thing here. Immediatly after the firſt deluge or floud in the time of <hi>Ogygius,</hi> this iland, as we find recorded by <hi>Solinus,</hi> before all other lands &amp; countries whatſoeuer, receiued the luſture of the ſun-beames, &amp; thereupon it obteined that name of <hi>DELOS,</hi> that is, <hi>Apparent,</hi> or <hi>eaſily &amp; ſoone deſcried.</hi> It had alſo other names giuen to it of other accidents and euents that fall out in the ſame: as namely, <hi>PELASGIA, LAGIA, ORTYGIA, CYNETHVM, CYNTHON, CHLAMIDIA, SCYTHIA, ANAPHE, ASTERIA,</hi> &amp;c. (But <hi>Aſteria</hi> was the name of a citie in this ile, which citie was afterward, as <hi>Apollodorus</hi> and <hi>Seruius</hi> do teſtifie, called alſo <hi>Delos.) Pliny</hi> nameth it <hi>ARTEMITA</hi> and <hi>CELADVSSA. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenaeus</hi> noteth three things here worthy of ſpeciall obſeruation; A market wonderfully furniſhed with all maner of victuall and dainty diſhes; The great multitudes of all maner of people dwelling in it; and The infinite number of paraſites, ſmell-feaſts or trencher-chaplaines belonging to this god. <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth of the fountaine or head of the riuer <hi>Inopus,</hi> that altogether in the ſame maner, and at the ſame time it doth ebbe and flowe with <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo that the people doe verily beleeue, that it commeth by ſecret paſſages vnder the ſea from the <hi>Nilus</hi> vnto them. The ſame authour maketh mention of certeine rocks of <hi>Delos (petrae Deli)</hi> where he ſaith, the fiſhes by nature are ſo ſalt, that one would deeme them to haue beene layd in pickle, and may well be accounted for ſalt-fiſh, and yet in the hauen of the ſame they are freſh. In old time the copper of <hi>Delos</hi> was held for the beſt, as we reade in the ſame authour. In his time, he affirmeth, there was a palme-tree ſtill to be ſeene, that had ſtood there euer ſince <hi>Apollo</hi> was borne. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> (who liued in the reigne of <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperour) writeth, that in his time this iland was ſo deſert and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled, that the gard of the Temple which the Athenians ſent thither being remoued, if one ſhould reckon only the Delians, was wholly waſte and void of inhabitants: It is wonderfull to ſee how time doth alter the ſtate of all things. In this iland it was not lawfull, as <hi>Strabo</hi> and others report, to keepe a dogge, to bury a dead man, or to burne his corps, as then the cuſtome was (<hi>Thucydides</hi> ſayth, that no man might either be borne, or die here.) Therefore the corpſes of dead men were from thence conueyed into the next ile called <hi>RHENIA,</hi> which is a very ſmall iland, waſte and wholly deſert, diſtant from hence not aboue foure furlongs. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth that <hi>Nicias</hi> made a bridge from one to the other. <hi>Thucydides</hi> in his <hi>1</hi> and <hi>3</hi> booke writeth, that it was taken by <hi>Polycrates</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Samus,</hi> annexed by a great long chaine to <hi>Delos,</hi> and conſecrated to <hi>Apollo Delius. Antigonus</hi> affirmeth, that neither cats nor ſtags do breed or liue here. <hi>Athenaeus</hi> deſcribeth a kinde of table that is made in this iland, &amp; therupon it is called <hi>Rheniarges.</hi> It was by violence of ſtorm rent off from <hi>Sicilia,</hi> &amp; vtterly drowned, as <hi>Lucian</hi> in his Marine dialogues, writeth.

Moreouer, they ſay, that in the confines of <hi>Gnoſia, (Cinoſa)</hi> neere the riuer <hi>Therene,</hi> the manage of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> with <hi>Iuno</hi> was celebrated and kept. The hiſtory of <hi>Minoes</hi> the Law-giuer: and <hi>Radamanthus,</hi> the ſeuere Iuſticier, hath made it more talked of, than any other ile in this ocean. That it is very full of mountaines and woods, and hath alſo diuers fertile valleies and champion plaines, <hi>Strabo</hi> doth ſufficiently witneſſe. <hi>Solinus</hi> maketh it to be a country well ſtored with wild goates. <hi>Item,</hi> he ſheweth that the ſheep, eſpecially about <hi>Gurtyna</hi>) are red and foure horn'd. <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth it, The natiue ſoile of the Cypreſſe tree: for which way ſoeuer any man ſhall goe, or whereſoeuer he ſhall offer to ſet his foote, eſpecially about mount <hi>Ida (Pſiloriti)</hi> and thoſe which they call, The white hils, except the ſoile be planted with other trees, this tree ſprowth vp, and that not only in any peculiar or made ground, but euery where of it owne accord naturally. <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Ariſtolochia Cretica.</hi> That there is heere no Owle, or any miſchieuous and harmefull creature, beſide the <hi>Phalangium,</hi> a kind of perillous Spider, <hi>Plutarch, Pl ny, Solinus, AElianus</hi> and <hi>Antigonius</hi> do iointly teſtifie. <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> in his 30. booke, doth commend the dogges or hounds of this iland for excellent hunters.

This, by the teſtimonie of <hi>Pauſanias</hi> in his <hi>Phocica,</hi> may be compared to thoſe iles which, either for greatneſſe or goodneſſe of ſoile, are moſt highlie commended. <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaith, That for greatneſſe, multitude of men, and all manner of excellent fruites, it beareth the bell from other ilands in this ſea. <hi>AElianus</hi> calleth it, The beſt nurce for cattell: <hi>Strabo</hi> maketh it, The beſt ſoile for corne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Florus</hi> termeth it, <hi>Annonae pignus,</hi> a pawne for all maner of prouiſion. <hi>Prudentius</hi> writeth, That a nauie, which ſhould bring ouer into <hi>Italy</hi> the ſtore of graine in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> would burſt all the barnes of <hi>Rome.

To theſe diſcommodities, the hearb <hi>Sardonia,</hi> alſo may be adioined, which, as <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> in the foureteenth chapter of his ſixth booke, writeth, that if it be eaten troubleth the braine, taketh away a mans memorie, maketh him yawne, and ſo to die as if he laughed. There is alſo the <hi>Solifuga,</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth it, or <hi>Solipungia,</hi> as <hi>Feſtus</hi>) a little creature, much like to the Spider, vpon which, whoſoeuer ſhall chance to ſit, he lightlie ſhalbe dangerouſlie hurt.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Ilands of the Ionian ſea, of better note, are theſe, <hi>Corcyra, Cephalenia, Zacynthus, Ithaca, Leucadia,</hi> and <hi>Echi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades:</hi> of which ſeuerally take theſe few lines: CORCYRA (now called <hi>Corfu</hi>) the natiue ſoile of <hi>Alcinous,</hi> as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſaith, was called CERCYRA, as alſo long ſince by diuers other names; as PHAEACIA, SCHERIA, DREPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVM, CERAVNIA, ARGOS, MACRIS, and as ſome thinke CASSIOPE; as thou maiſt ſee more particularly in our Geographicall Treaſury. This iland grew to ſuch great ſtrength and power, as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> writeth, that it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued many other ilands and cities, and brought them vnder their command: <hi>Item,</hi> that it was ſo ſtrong in ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that it alone, in the Perſian warre, did ſet out and furniſh threeſcore ſhippes. Yet afterward it was brought to that deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that of it became this prouerbe, <hi>Cercyra eſt libera, caca vbi volueris;</hi> Corfu is emptie now, you may vntruſſe where you liſt. There is another <hi>Corcyra,</hi> different from this, in the Hadriaticke ſea, named otherwiſe <hi>Melaena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CEPHALENIA, otherwiſe called MELAENA, SAMOS and TAPHOS: as alſo DVLICHIVM, as ſome men haue written, by the teſtimony of <hi>Strabo. Euſtathius</hi> and <hi>Tzetzes</hi> haue written that it was ſometime inhabited of foure ſundrie nations; namely, of the <hi>Pronij, Samij, Palenſes</hi> and the <hi>Cranij:</hi> to theſe <hi>Liuy</hi> addeth the <hi>Neſiotae.</hi> In this iland, if one may truſt <hi>Aelianus,</hi> the Goates drinke not for the ſpace of ſix moneths together. Looke in the diſcourſe of <hi>Zacynthus</hi> following. In <hi>Antigonus</hi> we read, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riuer runneth through the middeſt of it, vpon the one ſide of which there are great ſtore of graſſe-hoppers, and on the other ſide not one.</p>
               <p>ZACYNTHVS, (now <hi>Zante,</hi> and as <hi>Erythraeus</hi> ſaith, ſomtime <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>) HYRIA it was in old time called, and CASSIOPA, the poet nameth it <hi>Nemoroſa,</hi> woody. Theſe ilanders, <hi>Athenaeus</hi> ſaith, are no good ſouldiers; the reaſon he yeeldeth to be, for that they be very wealthy, and haue ſuch plenty of all things, that they giue themſelues to nought elſe but to their eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The <hi>Phalangium,</hi> a kind of ſpider, is heere more dangerous and hurtfull to mankind, than in any place of the world beſide, as <hi>AElianus</hi> ſaith. So long as the <hi>Eteſiae,</hi> (Eaſt windes which riſe ordinarily in the dogge daies) blow, the Goates ſtand yaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and gaping with their noſes vp into the North: and are ſo ſatisfied therewith, that they looke after no water nor euer care for drinke, as <hi>Antigonus</hi> hath left recorded. That in this iland there is a caue commonly called <hi>Coeranium, Plutarch,</hi> in his booke of the compariſons of beaſts, doth affirme. It hath a fountaine very full of fiſh: out of which great ſtore of pitch is taken, if we may giue credit to <hi>Cteſias. Item,</hi> heere <hi>F. Deſiderius Lignamineus Patauinus</hi> writeth that he found this Epitaph of <hi>Cicero;</hi> M. TVLLI. CICERO. HAVE; God be with thee good <hi>Cicero:</hi> which he ſaith was in the yeare 1544. <hi>Adamus Tefellenius Louanienſis</hi> in his Iournall (a manuſcript copy of which M. <hi>Hadrian Marſelar,</hi> lent me to read ouer) writeth, that he in this iland in the yeare of Chriſt 1550. handled the bones of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and read vpon his tombe this epitaph: <hi>Ille oratorum princeps, &amp; gloria linguae Romanae, iacet hac, cum coniuge Tullius, vrna: Tullius ille, inquam, de ſe, qui ſcripſerat olim, O fortunatam natam me conſule Romam.</hi> The learned <hi>Tully,</hi> who for fined tongue, in <hi>Rome</hi> had neuer peere, With louing wife, in clay full low, lie both enterred heere: That <hi>Tully</hi> great, I meane, who of himſelfe, ſometime thus proudlie ſaid: Now <hi>Rome,</hi> thou bleſſed art indeed, ſince I thy ſcepter ſwaied.</p>
               <p>ITHACA, which was alſo in old time called NERITIA, of <hi>Neritus</hi> a mountaine, if I be not deceiued, is now vulgarly of the Italians called <hi>Valle di Compare,</hi> and as <hi>Porcaccius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Teachi:</hi> of the Turkes, as the learned <hi>Lewnclawe</hi> writeth, <hi>Phiachi.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer in the 10. booke of <hi>Straboes</hi> Geography, I find that there is heere a city called <hi>Ithaca,</hi> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Greeke Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions nameth, <hi>Alalcome,</hi> but <hi>Stephanus, Alcomenae. Athenaeus</hi> writeth, that it hath many hauens, but withall is very mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, rough and craggie: ſo that it will not eaſily, without great and infinite labour and toile, yeeld any ſmall or meane profit, vnto the husbandmen, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> telleth vs. In <hi>Porphyry,</hi> out of the writings of <hi>Artimedorus,</hi> I read that this iland, from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normus,</hi> an hauen of <hi>Cephalina,</hi> lieth Eaſtward, and conteineth in compaſſe 85. furlongs. It is very narrow, but high. In it is, as the ſame authour, with <hi>Homer</hi> doth witneſſe, a caue of the Nymphs. We read in <hi>Antigonius,</hi> that it breedeth no Hares at all. Except it had been the natiue ſoile, and country where <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> was borne, there had no mention at all of it remained in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recordes of ancient writers.</p>
               <p>LEVCAS or LEVCADIA (now <hi>S. Maura</hi>) although <hi>Pliny</hi> maketh it but a <hi>peninſula</hi> or demy-ile, yet <hi>Mela</hi> calleth it flatly an iland. That it was made an iland and was ſeuered from the maine continent, yet afterward by force and violence of windes ioined to the ſame againe, <hi>Strabo</hi> doth teach vs. In a very high foreland or promontory of this ile, <hi>AElianus</hi> deſcribeth the temple of <hi>Apollo Aelius,</hi> from whence yearely they were wont to tumble ſome one or other downe into the ſea headlong, thereby to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath and fury of their Gods; as <hi>Strabo</hi> hath left recorded.</p>
               <p>ECHINADES, (<hi>Echidnae, Seneca</hi> in his <hi>Troas,</hi> and <hi>Euripides</hi> in <hi>Iphegenia</hi> in <hi>Aulide,</hi> call them: but <hi>Stephanus, Echinae</hi>) ſo named of the great multitude of the <hi>Echini,</hi> Vrchines or Hedge-hogges, which do greatly infect this iland. <hi>Apollodorus</hi> calleth them, STROPHADES; now they are knowen by the name of the <hi>Cozzulari:</hi> they are, as <hi>Ouid</hi> in the 8. booke of his <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, in number 5. theſe were alſo part of the continent, as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> in his <hi>Arcadia,</hi> teſtifieth; their forme and faſhion is often altered and changed by the ebbing and flowing (if I may ſo ſpeake) of the mudde of the riuer <hi>Achelous (Aſpri</hi> or <hi>Pachicolamo</hi>) at whoſe mouth they ſtand, as <hi>Strabo</hi> would faine perſwade vs. Neere theſe are the <hi>Taphiae</hi> and <hi>Acutae,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Thoae. Plutarch</hi> in his treatiſe of the ceaſſing of oracles, telleth a ſtory (or fable, rather) worth the reading, of the death of <hi>Pan,</hi> which tell out about theſe ilands.</p>

The bounds of this prouince of <hi>Africa</hi> on the Weſt are the riuer <hi>Ampſaga,</hi> and the Mauritania's, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Moores, their next neighbours: on the North, lieth the Midland ſea: <hi>Arae Philenorum,</hi> a village betweene it and <hi>Cyrenaica,</hi> is the vttermoſt bound of it Eaſtward: the <hi>Inner Libya</hi> and the deſerts of the ſame do confine it vpon the South.

Diodorus Siculus</hi> diuideth this prouince into foure nations, the <hi>Poeni, Libophoenices, Libyi,</hi> and the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midae.</hi> At ſuch time as the Romans bore a ſway here, and <hi>Scipio Aemilianus</hi> commanded their legions in theſe parts, this <hi>Africa</hi> was diuided into two prouinces: that neere <hi>Carthage,</hi> they called <hi>OLDE AFRICA:</hi> that which conteined <hi>Numidia, NEW AFRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CA,</hi> as <hi>Pliny, Appian</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> do ioyntly teſtifie. <hi>Numidia,</hi> and <hi>Byzacium,</hi> were vnder the command of the Conſuls; that wherein <hi>Carthage</hi> ſtood, belonged to the iuriſdiction of the Proconſuls, as <hi>Sextus Rufus</hi> reporteth. (And this diuiſion they made, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, by a certaine ditch drawen betweene them.) In the firſt booke of <hi>Iuſtinians Code,</hi> and in the ſeuen and twentieh title of the ſame, thou ſhalt finde another maner of diuiſion of this countrey, and a farre other maner of gouernment of it by Preſidents and Lieutenants. <hi>Numidia,</hi> beſide the great ſtore of Marble there found, called by the name of Numidian marble, and the maruellous plenty of Deere and wilde beaſts which it yeeldeth, hath nothing worth the remembrance, as <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth. <hi>Liuy, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> do giue it the praiſe for the beſt horſmen for ſeruice in the warres, of any countrey whatſoeuer. They doe as highly commend the fat ſoile of <hi>Byzacium;</hi> which is ſuch that it yeeldeth an hundred for one: yea, it hath beene knowen, that one buſhell of wheat being ſowen, hath yeelded at harueſt the increaſe of an hundred and fifty buſhels againe. The Lieutenant of this place ſent from thence vnto <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> forty eares of corne ſprung and growen vp from one root, and one graine, as was probable. Item there were ſent likewiſe to <hi>Nero</hi> from thence three hundred and forty ſtalks with eares of corne come vp of one and the ſome graine. To this alſo may be adioyned the goodneſſe of the ſoile, which is ſuch, as <hi>Columella</hi> reporteth of it, that the huſbandman, after he hath layd his ſeed in the ground, from ſeed-time to harueſt, neuer looketh to his fields, nor once medleth with it more, for that ſearſe any weed or other ſuch thing, which vſually hindereth the growth of corne, doth here come vp of it owne accord, except it be either ſet or ſowen by hand. <hi>Halicarnaſſeus</hi> alſo maketh mention of this great fertility of <hi>Africa.</hi> But <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> in one word, doth ſufficiently declare the woonderfully fruitfulneſſe and plenty of all things here, in an Oration of his written vnto the ſeditious and mutinous Iewes, where he nameth it, <hi>Altricem orbis terrarum,</hi> The nourſe of all nations of the world. Yea and <hi>Saluianus</hi> in his ſeuenth booke ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it, <hi>Animam Reipublicae Romanae,</hi> The ſoule of the Romane Common-wealth, or politicke body there; where thou mayſt reade many other things worth the obſeruation, of the riches, command and power of this countrey. <hi>Herodian</hi> maketh it a country very fertile of men. <hi>Polybius</hi> on the other ſide doth as much commend it for the great abundance of cattell and all ſorts of liuing creatures that it breedeth. So that for multitude of Horſes, Oxen, Sheepe, and Goats, it doth farre ſurpaſſe almoſt all the reſt of the world beſide. And that which is moſt woonderfull of all other, it is no ſtrange thing here (as <hi>Columella,</hi> out of <hi>Dionyſius, Mago,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Varro,</hi> telleth vs) to ſee Mules to breed, and bring forth yoong: ſo that the inhabitants do as oft ſee the foales of Mules there, as we do of Mares here. The ſame authour in the firſt chapter of his fourth booke ſayth that the people are very ingenious and witty. <hi>Hirtius</hi> calleth it, <hi>Gentem inſidioſam,</hi> A treacherous nation: <hi>Maternus</hi> nameth it, <hi>Gentem ſubdolam,</hi> A wily and crafty people: ſo that <hi>Vlgetius</hi> doubted not to ſay, That for wiles and wealth the Romans were alwayes inferiour to the Africans. <hi>Iuuenal</hi> the Poet termeth it, <hi>Cauſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum nut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, there is, as he there addeth, no maner of wickedneſſe or villany that they are not giuen vnto. All hiſtories do make mention of the vnfaithfulneſſe and falſe-heartedneſſe of this nation: which indeed is ſuch, and they for the ſame ſo greatly noted and famous, that they grew for it into a common by-word among all ſuch nations as had any conuerſation or ought to do with them. And thus much of this <hi>Africa,</hi> a land, as the Poets terme it, moſt rich for triumphs; the fortreſſe or caſtle, as <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth it, of all Prouinces belonging to the Romane Empire.

               <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> builded here and repaired, <hi>Procopius</hi> in his ſixth booke of the buildings of this Emperour, relateth at large. Of him alſo if we may giue credit to <hi>Balſamon,</hi> it was called <hi>IVSTINIANA.</hi> The builders of this city, which layd the firſt foundations of it, were the Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians <hi>Xorus</hi> and <hi>Carchedon,</hi> or, as ſome other report, <hi>Eliſſa</hi> or <hi>Dido,</hi> King <hi>Agenors</hi> daughter, fifty yeeres before the ouerthrow of <hi>Troy:</hi> or three ſcore and twelue yeeres before the building of the city of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Appianus</hi> affirmeth. <hi>Siluis Italicus</hi> ſayth that <hi>Teucer</hi> was the firſt that began the foundation of this city. It was built, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his diſputation againſt <hi>Appion</hi> writeth, in the hundred and fiue and fifty yeere after the death of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> the glorious king of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The valour and great ſtrength of this city, as it was alwayes eminent and famous in forren warres abroad, ſo hath beene often ſhaken and ouermaſtered many &amp; ſundry times at home. At length hauing ſtood in flouriſhing eſtate, as moſt authours affirme, ſeuen hundred and ſeuen and thirty yeeres, it was by the Romans, as an enuious enemy of their ſtate and empire, aſſaulted, battered, taken, ſacked, vtterly ſpoiled, and at laſt conſumed to duſt and aſhes. And thus it continued for the ſpace of one hundred and one yeeres: when by the commandement and preſcript of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it was againe reedified, who, ſending thither certeine people to inhabit and dwell there, made it a Romane colony: and this was the firſt colony of the Romans that euer was tranſported foorth of <hi>Italy.</hi> It was of <hi>Cayus Gracchus</hi> called <hi>IVNONIA,</hi> as it is recorded by <hi>Appian, Solinus,</hi> and <hi>Dion;</hi> who alſo addeth that it was afterward by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> againe the ſecond time made a Colony: becauſe that when <hi>Lepidus</hi> had waſted a great part of it, and left it deſtitute and without inhabitants, he in maner ſeemed to haue diſſolued the right and priuiledge of the Colony. Therefore this city began againe to flouriſh, and vnder the Romane Emperours, to be renowmed vnder the name of <hi>The ſecond Carthage.</hi> So that that city which lately was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed for ſeats of armes and martiall prowes, was now, as <hi>Martianus</hi> writeth, as honourable for worldly felicity and all maner of earthly bleſſings. It taſted alſo of the beneuolence and bounteous magnificence of the Emperour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and thereupon it was of him called <hi>HADRIANOPOLIS,</hi> that is, <hi>Hadrians city,</hi> as <hi>Spartianus</hi> hath left recorded. Item, the Romane Emperour <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> did much grace it with many ſumptuous and ſtately buildings as you may reade in <hi>Pauſanias. Lampridius</hi> writeth, that in reſpect of the fauourable kindneſſe of the Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> toward this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was in like maner of him named <hi>ALEXANDRIA COMMODIANA TOGATA.</hi> But, (as the ſtate of all things vnder the cope of heauen is vnconſtant and variable) the ſame city vnder <hi>Gordianus</hi> the Emperour, was, as <hi>Herodian</hi> teſtifieth, by one <hi>Capellianus</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Mauritania</hi> taken the ſecond time, and ſpoiled, about ſix hundred and foure ſcore yeeres after it firſt had ſubmitted it ſelfe to the command and iuriſdiction of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. In the reigne of <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperour it was by treachery the third time taken, ſacked, and vtterly defaced, by <hi>Genſerichus</hi> king of the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, in the foure hundred and thirty yeere after the incarnation of <hi>CHRIST</hi> our Sauiour. The like it ſuffered of certeine mutinous ſouldiers vnder one <hi>Salomon</hi> a lieutenant of the <hi>Mauruſij,</hi> or <hi>Barbary,</hi> as <hi>Procopius</hi> hath recorded. From theſe it was woon by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> in the yeere of <hi>CHRIST</hi> fiue hundred thirty eight, in the time of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Romane Emperour, who cauſed it to be repaired, and fortified with a ſtrong wall and deepe ditch; who moreouer beautified it with many goodly publike buildings, of moſt curious architecture, as Cloiſters, Galleries, the Theodorian Bathes, the gorgeous Church of our Lady, the chiefe Saint, and others which are reckoned vp by the ſame <hi>Procopius.</hi> After this it continued vnder the Romans vntill the time of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour, when as it was conquered and ſurpriſed by the Perſians, about the yeere of <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſix hundred and ſixteene. It was taken, ſacked, and ſpoiled by the Egyptians, three ſcore and ſix yeeres after that, as <hi>Procopius</hi> and others do conſtantly witneſſe. Neither was this the laſt miſery of this city: for it being ſpoiled, raſed almoſt to the ground, layed waſte, and left diſpeopled and void of inhabitants, by the Mahumetanes; ſo continued vnto the dayes of one <hi>Elmahdi</hi> a Biſhop, who, as <hi>Iohannes Leo Africanus</hi> reporteth, gaue it vnto certeine people of that countrey, which were in number ſo few, that they did not repleniſh aboue the twentieth part of it. The ſame authour, an eye witneſſe of that which he wrote, affirmeth that of all this greatneſſe and glory, beſide certeine ruines of the walles and a part of the Conduit, there remaineth at thus day not any whit or mention at all. This now in theſe our dayes is the fate and forme of this moſt goodly city. This is that city, which, as <hi>Herodian</hi> teſtifieth, in time paſt for wealth, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people, and greatneſſe of circuit, did only yeeld it ſelfe inferiour to <hi>Rome;</hi> and with <hi>Alexandria</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> long contended for the ſecond place. Item, this is it which long ſince was of that power that it commanded all the ſea coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> from <hi>Arae Philenorum,</hi> all along as far as to the Straights of <hi>Gibraltar:</hi> ouer which they paſſing by ſhip, conquered all <hi>Spaine,</hi> euen vp as high as the Pyreny mountaines. So that <hi>Appian,</hi> a graue writer, doth deeme the Empire and command of this city, of equall value to the power of the far-commanding Greeks, or wealth &amp; riches of the braue Perſian: which were an eaſie matter for one to iuſtify out of <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> two authours of good credit. For this man affirmeth, that this city commanded in <hi>Africa</hi> alone three hundred cities; and it ſelfe conteined ſeuenty thouſand men, dayly inhabitants within the walles of the ſame. Item, <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this city, tranſported from thence vnto <hi>Rome</hi> foure hundred and ſeuenty thouſand pound weight of ſiluer. Of this city, (which, as long as it ſtood out, and was maſter of it ſelfe, as <hi>Trogus</hi> witneſſeth, was eſteemed as a goddeſſe; and in <hi>Africa,</hi> as <hi>Saluianus</hi> writeth, was accounted as another <hi>Rome</hi>) there remaineth now no more but the bare name onely. Of the nation of the Africans, from whence they came into this country, and what they were, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi> in the eleuenth booke of his Hiſtory of the Wandals, hath written ſomewhat worth the obſeruation.</p>
            <p>Of Heauen-walke, <hi>(Via coeleſtis)</hi> which we in a word touched before, I thinke it not amiſſe here in this place to ſpeake ſomewhat more at large. In <hi>Victor Vticenſis</hi> theſe words following are read in all copies that euer I ſaw: <hi>Nam &amp; hodiè ſi qua ſuperſunt, ſubinde deſolantur, ſicut in Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo Theatro aedem Memoriae &amp; viam quam Caeleſtis vocitabant, funditus deleuerunt.</hi> For <hi>viam,</hi> I make no question but the authour did write <hi>etiam,</hi> that it might be referred to <hi>aedem,</hi> (or <hi>templum,</hi> as <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> in <hi>Pertinax,</hi> doth call it) that is, a chapell, temple or church. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, of this <hi>Caeleſtis dea,</hi> Heauenly goddeſſe, as <hi>Capitolinus</hi> in <hi>Macrinus</hi> and <hi>Trebellius Pollio</hi> in <hi>Celſus tyrannus,</hi> do call her a goddeſſe peculiar to <hi>Africa,</hi> there are here and there diuers things to be obſerued in diuers authours. <hi>Aelianus</hi> writeth that the Egyptians doe call <hi>Venus, Vrania,</hi> that is, Heauenly. <hi>Venus caeleſtis</hi> (which is all one) is expreſſed in an ancient piece of coine which I haue of <hi>Iulia Soëmia's. S. Auguſtine</hi> in his booke <hi>De ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitate Dei</hi> doth ſpeake of the Heauenly Virgine <hi>(Virgo caeleſtis)</hi> meaning doubtleſſe the Heauenly goddeſſe: but by that epithite, I ſuppoſe, he had a purpoſe to diſtinguiſh her from that other; I meane that wanton, which <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> calleth <hi>Venerem virginem. Herodian</hi> nameth her <hi>Vrania;</hi> and addeth moreouer, that of the Phoenicians ſhe is called <hi>Aſtroarche. Alilat, Herodotus</hi> ſayth ſhe was named, and affirmeth that it is the Moone. <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in his treatiſe againſt <hi>Symmachus</hi> writeth that the Perſians call her <hi>Mithra. idque pro diuerſitate nominis, non pro numinis varietate;</hi> all theſe different names ſignifying, as <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, one and the ſame goddeſſe. <hi>Apuleius</hi> in the ſixth booke of his Golden Aſſe, witneſſeth that all the nations of the Eaſt countreys do generally call her <hi>Zigia.</hi> There is a notable record of this goddeſſe, this <hi>Caeleſtis Venus,</hi> in the eleuenth booke of the ſame treatiſe of <hi>Apuleius:</hi> which he there calleth both by the name of <hi>Regina caeli,</hi> The Queene of heauen; and <hi>Syria dea,</hi> the Syrian goddeſſe. Of whoſe diuers and manifold forme or ſhape, the great variety of diſtinct and different names of the ſame, if any man be deſirous to know more particularly, let him haue recourſe to this foreſayd authour, as alſo to Lucians treatiſe intituled <hi>De Dea Syria;</hi> to which if he ſhall adioyne certeine coines of the Emperours, <hi>Seuerus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus</hi> his ſonne, he ſhall vnderſtand that in this one idoll, almoſt all the diuinity of the ancient Gentiles is comprehended. <hi>Philaſtrius,</hi> who wrote of the hereſies of former times, ſayth that this goddeſſe was of certeine hereticall Iewes named <hi>Fortuna caeli,</hi> Heauenly fortune. I might eaſily be drawen to beleeue, that this very goddeſſe is that idoll which <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the foure and fortieth chapter of his Propheſie, doth terme The Queene of heauen. To whom the wicked Iſraelites did offer ſacrifice, and reuerence as to the immortall God. For it was not hard for this nation, ſo prone and inclined to idolatry, out of their next neighbour <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> (where <hi>Lucian</hi> teſtifieth this goddeſſe was moſt religiouſly worſhipped) to tranſport this idoll into their countrey <hi>Palaeſtina,</hi> as the Phoenicians did out of the ſame <hi>Syria</hi> conuey her beyond the ſea to <hi>Carthage:</hi> vnder the conduct and leading, as is probable (and which <hi>Herodotus</hi> iuſtifieth to be true) of Queene <hi>Dido, Agenors</hi> daughter. Many other things of this goddeſſe, out of diuers other authours, might heere to theſe be adioyned: but we at this time are content, with <hi>Plato</hi> to demonſtrate that there were two <hi>Venuſes:</hi> of which, one, whom the Carthaginians did worſhip, was this which hitherto we haue ſpoken of: that ſame, I meane, which was called <hi>Dea Syria,</hi> or <hi>Venus Aſſyria,</hi> as <hi>Oppian</hi> in his firſt booke of Hunting calleth her. This, I do vnderſtand out of the ſixt booke of <hi>Apuleius,</hi> was the ſame that <hi>Iuno</hi> was, where he termeth her <hi>Vecturam leonis,</hi> The burden or cariage of the lion: and whom they report, Did loue olde <hi>Carthage</hi> more than all the world beſide: for here her charet alwayes ſtood, her weapons here did lie; as the Poet writeth of her: whereupon I make no queſtion, the city <hi>Carthage</hi> was for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo called <hi>Iunonia:</hi> for ſo I finde it recorded by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Solinus.</hi> By her <hi>Charet,</hi> I vnderſtand the <hi>Lion,</hi> vpon which ſhe rode: by her <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,</hi> the <hi>thunderbolt,</hi> with the other enſignes of the gods and goddeſſes, which in thoſe forenamed coines are expreſſed. <hi>Saluianus</hi> in his booke <hi>De Prouidentia,</hi> maketh mention of an Heauenly god <hi>(Deus caeleſtis)</hi> an idoll alſo of the Africans. <hi>Vlpianus</hi> in like maner, in the Tit. <hi>qui haeredes inſtitui poſſunt, § deo haeredis,</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Caeleſtis deus Salinenſis Carthaginenſis.</hi> But this is nothing to this our goddeſſe.

The Abaſſines, Ethiopians and other nations inhabiting neere vnto it, do call it by diuers and ſundry other names, as thou mayeſt ſee more at large in our Geographicall treaſury. It vnladeth it ſelfe, as moſt men thinke, and all antiquity hath conſtantly affirmed, into the Midland ſea by ſeuen mouthes or very great floudgates. <hi>Ptolemey</hi> in his time made mention of nine, but of them, two were falſe gates (<hi>pſeudoſtomata,</hi> he termeth them) then almoſt quite ſtopped vp. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaketh of eleuen, of which foure were falſe gates, the other ſeuen were great and more renowmed. <hi>Herodotus</hi> alſo mentioneth two falſe gates, but in all he ſpeaketh not of more than ſeuen: with him <hi>Euſtathius</hi> word for word agreeth. And that which of theſe mouthes or falles are of this man held for a trueth, in others are held for falſe and contrariwiſe.

For euery man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth them according to the ſituation of the ſea coaſt, as it then was in that time wherein he liued, which by violence of tide and inundatious, drifts of ſand and ſhifting of the ſame backe againe, in proceſſe of time haue ſometime one forme, ſomtime another, as is very likely, and they do very well know which dwell neere to the ſea; who do neuer wonder to ſee riuers change their channels and leaue their ancient courſe: to ſee their mouthes ſometime to be quite dette vp with ſand, and to ſeeke new iſſues and channels, where neuer none were before: or to ſee them which in former times were not nauigable, but full of flats and ſhelfs, afterward to become deepe and able to entertaine ſhips of good burden. <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, that this riuer, for goodneſſe of water, hath but few peeres. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethaeus</hi> the Cappadotian ſayth that the water is thicke: <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the eighth booke of his <hi>Conuiual.</hi> calleth it <hi>turbidam</hi> troubled, and muddy: <hi>Statius</hi> in his fourth booke <hi>Amor.</hi> ſayth that it is ſweet, and coole without any vnpleaſantneſſe in taſte: and therefore he addeth in the ſame place that the Egyptians do neuer feare any want or dearth of wine. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſayth, that for ſweetneſſe it doth ſurpaſſe all other riuers in the whole world beſide: which opinion of his, <hi>Peſcennius Niger,</hi> an Emperor, did long ſince auouch to be true, when he thus anſwered his garriſon ſouldiers, demanding wine of him, Haue ye <hi>Nilus,</hi> and yet do ye demand wine?

What the great fertility and richneſſe of ſoile of this prouince was, that worthy commendation vulgarly ſpoken of it, wherein it is ſayd to be, <hi>The common barne of all the world,</hi> doth ſufficiently ſhew. For, although it neuer raineth here, yet it breedeth great plenty of men and beaſts, with all maner of cattell whatſoeuer. But this indeed their riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> by his inundation euery yeere, bringeth to paſſe: wherupon, as the poet <hi>Lucan</hi> writeth, this is <hi>Terra ſuis contenta bonis, non indiga mercis, Aut Iouis: in ſolo tanta eſt fiducia Nilo:</hi> A land that of it ſelfe is rich enough, It need'th no forren aid, Ioues helpe it ſcorn'th: ſo much it ſtand'th, vpon the bounty of the Nile. Yea they were woont proudly to vaunt, as <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifieth, that they caried in their hands the dearth or plenty of the Romans thoſe mighty conquerours. The riches and wealth of this countrey one may eaſily eſteeme, by that of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> who writeth that the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> vſed yerely to haue, of <hi>Alexandria</hi> only, a Subſidie of aboue twelue thouſand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; item, out of <hi>Strabo,</hi> in whom I reade that <hi>Auletes,</hi> father to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> leuied yeerely in <hi>Egypt</hi> a Subſidie of twelue thouſand and fiue hundred talents (which doth amount, according to <hi>Budey</hi> his estimation, to ſeuenty fiue hundred thouſand French crownes:) and that, as he there addeth, vnder a very looſe and bad kinde of gouernment. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his ſecond booke <hi>de Praepar.

But ſo many endleſſe and immortall works yet extant, hauing hitherto euen to this day abode all aſſaults and iniury of time, do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew what their great command and power in former times hath beene; as namely, are thoſe huge <hi>Pyramides,</hi> ſo many <hi>Obelisks</hi> of ſolid marble of one whole ſtone of ſuch woonderfull height, <hi>Coloſſes, Sphinges, Statues,</hi> and <hi>Labyrinths:</hi> ſo many gorgeous <hi>Temples,</hi> of which this one countrey could ſhew more than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countreys beſide whatſoeuer, as <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who himſelfe was an eye-witneſſe of the ſame, doth plainly affirme. The infinite number of people and inhabitants (which <hi>Philo,</hi> in his booke of Circumciſion, aſcribeth vnto it) gather out of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> and <hi>Egeſippus,</hi> who writeth, that beſide the citizens of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (which as <hi>Diodorus</hi> teſtifieth, were three hundred thouſand free men) there were ſeuenteene hundred and fifty thouſand enrolled and made free-deniſons of <hi>Rome</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>It is a very prudent and wiſe nation, as we may vnderſtand by diuers hiſtories; very ingenious in the finding out of any maner of artes and ſciences: very quicke of conceit in the ſearch of any inuention whatſoeuer, as <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> hath left recorded.

And <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> ſayth that they are a light hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and giddy brained people, more fit to ſet matters abroach, than to follow them wiſely, when they are once afoot. <hi>Hadrianus</hi> the Emperour, as <hi>Flauius Vopiſcus</hi> in the life of <hi>Saturninus</hi> reporteth, calleth it, <hi>Gentem leuem, pendulam, &amp; ad omnia famae monimenta volitantem:</hi> A light and vnconſtant nation, hanging as it were by a twin'd thread, and mooued at the leaſt blaſt and puffe of newes that might ſtirre. <hi>Seneca</hi> to <hi>Albina</hi> calleth it <hi>Infidam,</hi> A faithleſſe nation. <hi>Vento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam &amp; inſolentem.</hi> A bragging, proud and inſolent nation. <hi>Pliny,</hi> in his Panegyricke to Traian the Emperour, termeth them: <hi>Nequitias tellus ſcit dare nulla magis:</hi> No countrey in the world I am ſure, More vilder knaues did ere endure, ſayth the Poet <hi>Martiall. Philo</hi> in his booke of Huſbandry ſayth that they haue <hi>Innatam &amp; inſignem iactantiam,</hi> that is, that, they it bred in the bone that an Egyptian ſhould be a famous bragger.

The moſt famous cities, which we haue read of in the ancient writers of both languages, are theſe: Firſt, <hi>ALEXANDRIA,</hi> which <hi>Athenaeus</hi> nameth The beautifull and golden citie: the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> The great citie: <hi>Marcelline,</hi> The head of all cities in the world: <hi>Eunapius,</hi> Another world. <hi>Dion Pruſaeus</hi> ſayth, that it is the ſecond citie of all that are vnder the cope of heauen. The chiefe temple heere called <hi>Sebaſteum</hi> (or <hi>Auguſteum,</hi> that is, Princely, or, Emperiall) hath no peere. This thou mayſt ſee deſcribed by <hi>Philo Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi> in his booke <hi>De vita contemplatiua.</hi> The <hi>Serapium,</hi> another ſtately building in this citie, ſo adorned and beautified with diuers goodly galleries, many gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and lofty columnes and pillars, ſet out with moſt liuely imagery, and diuers and ſundry other rare works and deuices, the beſt that the moſt excellent Architects of the world might inuent, that next after the Capitoll, of which reuerend <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſo much glory, the whole world it ſelfe hath neuer ſeene ought more rich and ſumptuous, at <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> writeth of it. <hi>Strabo</hi> in the ſeuenteenth booke of his Geography, doth moſt brauely deſcribe the whole citie. The like doth <hi>Statius Alexandrinus</hi> in his fifth booke of Loue: and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in the <hi>17</hi> booke of his hiſtory. Item, <hi>Hirtius</hi> in his booke <hi>De bello Alexandrino. THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BAE</hi> was the next citie of great note, famous for the multitude of gates that ſometimes it had: and thereupon it was otherwiſe called <hi>Hecatompylos,</hi> Hundred-gate; and <hi>Dioſpolis,</hi> Gods-towne: item, <hi>Buſyris:</hi> and <hi>Thebeſtis,</hi> as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> affirmeth. <hi>MEMPHIS,</hi> an ancient towne, renowmed by reaſon that their kings ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily kept their Court here, was accounted one of the greateſt cities of this kingdome. <hi>COPTOS,</hi> a great Mart-towne, well frequented with Arabian and Indian merchants. Of this city the whole prouince tooke the name, as we haue elſwhere ſhewed before. <hi>ABYDVS,</hi> the Court and Emperiall ſeat of <hi>Memnon</hi> their king, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the temple of <hi>Oſiris.</hi> I omit <hi>SYENE</hi> with diuers others: for it were more than needeth here to recken them vp all; becauſe they offer themſelues at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, to him that ſhall but caſt his eye on the Map. Beſides that, <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus, Pliny, Ioſephus, Marcellinus, Philoſtratus, Euſebius,</hi> and diuers other good authours, yet extant, and in many mens hands, haue moſt eloquently and diligently deſcribed them, and ſet them out in their true and liuely colours.</p>
            <p>The ſituation of this countrey, the riuers, mountaines, cities and ſtrange things there to be ſeene, we haue already deſcribed, according as the capacity of the place aſſigned, would permit. Now it remaineth that with like breuity alſo we do, out of <hi>Diodorus, Herodotus, Strabo, Athenaeus, Aelianus, Plutarch, Philo, Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Pliny, Heliodorus, Lucian, Ammian, Clemens, Athanaſius, Prudentius,</hi> and others, ſpeake ſomething of their religion. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>De Praepar. Euang.</hi> teacheth me, that the Egyptians were the firſt men, that euer honoured the Sunne, Moone and the reſt of the Starres, for immortall Gods. But not only the Holy ſcripture, but euen profane authours alſo doe plentifully teſtifie that they were euer from the beginning the vaineſt men of the world, and in this their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice, and choice of gods, of all other moſt fond and fooliſh: for beſide the gods of the Gentiles, as <hi>Iupiter, Iuno, Vulcane, Venus, Bacchus,</hi> and ſuch others, which they had and worſhipped common with all the world, (yet by their ſeuerall and different names, as <hi>Iſis, Oſiris, &amp;c.</hi>) they moreouer, as <hi>Artemidorus</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> in the third booke of the Nature of gods do teſtifie, conſecrated all kinde of beaſts and liuing creatures. <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirmeth, that they accounted all maner of beaſts which they had in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as ſacred and holy; ſo that, as <hi>Dion</hi> reporteth, they farre ſurpaſſed all nations of the world in multitude and variety of gods. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they only reuerence theſe as gods, but alſo <hi>Anubis, Orus, Typhon, Pan</hi> (whom they called <hi>Mendon</hi> and painted him with a goats head) and the Satyrs. Item another, which, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Oſiris</hi> writeth, they called <hi>Cneph.</hi> Moreouer, <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> ſayth, that they worſhipped a man, and in the city <hi>Anabis</hi> did all maner of diuine ſeruice vnto him, as vnto an immortall God, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> auoucheth; who furthermore addeth, that they had another peculiar god, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Canopus,</hi> and expreſſed in the forme of a pot. (This <hi>Bembus</hi> hath deſcribed in his Hieroglyphicall table.) <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Heliodorus</hi> doe teſtifie, that they accounted the water, but eſpecially <hi>Nilus,</hi> for a god. Of foure footed beaſts, the Crocodile, the Oxe, the Mneuis, the Lion, the Beare, the Cat, the Hee-goat, the Monkey, the Ape, the Bull, the Ramme, the Shee-goat, the Hogge, the Dogge, the Ichneumon or Indian rat, the Woolfe, the Sheepe, the Weazell, and the Shrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, they put into the inuentory of their gods. Of fiſhes, the Oxyrinchus, the Lepidotus, the Latus, the Phagrus, the Maeotis (fiſhes proper to the riuer <hi>Nilus</hi>) and the Eccle: beſide the Cantharus, as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> in his booke <hi>De ſacrificijs</hi> teſtifieth. Of birds, the Eagle, the Ibis, and the Hawke: beſide the Owſell or Blacke-bird, if we may beleeue <hi>Hyginus:</hi> and the Vulture and Rauen, as <hi>Aelianus</hi> affirmeth: with the Sparrow, as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>De Abſtinentia,</hi> maketh vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his ſecond booke againſt <hi>Appion</hi> ſayth that they worſhip the Ferrit. They had beſide theſe, the Dragon, (or ſerpent) the Aſpis (which they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Thermathis</hi>) and the Beetle. The counterfets of theſe for the moſt part they adored and worſhipped as gods; yet ſome delighted rather to honour the very beast themſelues aliue: ſo that it was felony for a man to kill any of them, although it were by chance. And if ſo be that one of them ſhould fortune to die of any diſeaſe, they vſed to bury it with mourning and great ſolemnity. Item certaine vegetable things without life, as Onions, Leekes, and Garleeke, they did adore with diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> againſt <hi>Iouinian,</hi> teſtifieth of the <hi>Peluſiotae.</hi> Nay they did not content themſelues with theſe naturall things, but euen certeine monſters, ſuch as were neuer ſeene in the world, they did in like maner conſecrate for gods: as the Cynocephalus, with a dogges head, worſhipped of the Hermopolitani: and Cepus, honoured of the Babylonians. To theſe you may adde out of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the Serpenticipites, idols with ſerpents heads: and Aſinicipites, with aſſes heads. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in the villages and vpland townes, <hi>Lucian</hi> reporteth, (I know not whether in ieſt or earneſt) that ſome held the right ſhoulder for a god: but thoſe that dwelt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer againſt them, the left. Some did ſacrifice to the one halfe of the head: others to a Samian cup or diſh. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> reporteth, (I bluſh to ſpeake it) that they accounted the priuy parts for a god. <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in the ſecond booke <hi>De praeparat. Euangel.</hi> ſeemeth to reſtraine it only to <hi>Oſiris. Clemens</hi> in the fifth booke of his <hi>Recognitionum</hi> addeth (bluſh fooliſh idolaters, for I will tell it, and let another ſay ſurreuerence) that the Egyptians worſhipped the Iakes and a Part for their gods; which alſo is auerred and iuſtified by <hi>Minutius Felix.</hi> This is that which <hi>Lactantius</hi> reporteth of them, that they reuerenced certaine beaſtly and ſhamefull things. <hi>Philo Iudaeus</hi> ſayth, that all things vnder the cope of heauen are conſecrated and enrowled amongst the number of their gods. And <hi>Sextus</hi> the Philoſopher ſayth of them, that there was not any thing which they did not hold for ſacred. Thus much of their gods: more thou mayeſt ſee of this matter in <hi>Clemens,</hi> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in <hi>Iuuenall</hi> the Poet. Theſe do hold themſelues to be the firſt and moſt ancient Nation in the world, and to haue firſt had the knowledge of God, to haue built tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, groues and conuents in honour of them, as <hi>Lucian</hi> teſtifieth. Afterward, when the light of the Goſpell began to ſhine forth, here great ſwarmes of Monkes and Heremites were bred, and from hence were ſpred and ſcattered all Chriſtendome ouer, as we finde in the Records of the Primitiue Church: ſo that a man may iuſtly terme this countrey The Seminary or Nurſery of all religions. Of the Philoſophy, and Hieroglyphicall ſecrets of the Egyptians, reade the ſixt booke of <hi>Clemens Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrinus</hi> his Stromaton.

            <head>The VOIAGE of ALEXANDER THE GREAT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Archelaus the Chorographer, whom Diogenes Laërtius affirmeth to haue deſcribed all that part of the earthly globe or maine continent conquered by Alexander the Great, that famous king of Macedony: or Beton [<hi>Baeton,</hi> Athenaeus calleth him] and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genetus, whom Pliny writeth were the meaſurers of the iourney of the ſaid Alexander: or if the Commentaries of Strabo, which he ſaith that he compoſed of the hiſtories and famous acts of that great Conquerour, were now extant, it would out of all doubt haue beene an eaſier matter for vs to haue made this map which heere we purpoſe to ſet foorth to the view and benefit of the ſerious ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Geography, of the VOIAGE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT: But being deſtitute of thoſe helpes, firſt we haue laid the plot of it out of Ptolemey, and ſome other later writers. Then we haue ſet downe in it all thoſe particular places which Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Curtius, Arrianus and Plutarch doe make mention of in the hiſtorie of this expedition. For theſe three, of all thoſe which haue at large written of his life, and are come to our hands, haue of purpoſe handled this his voiage and expedition. To theſe, as helps, we haue adioined what we finde making for this our purpoſe, in Strabo, Diodorus, Trogus, Oroſius and Plutarch, in that his booke which he hath intituled, Of the fortune and proſperous ſucceſſe of Alexander, for theſe men, although they haue not purpoſedly intended that argument, yet notwithſtanding by the way they haue ſhewed themſelues, in the ſetting out of his memorable acts, very diligent and faithfull authours. Item Philoſtratus, Solinus and Pliny haue in like maner done vs ſome ſeruice heerein. And while I looke ouer all maner of hiſtories written either in Greeke or Latine, by any other authours whatſoeuer, beſide thoſe aboue named, I could picke very little or nothing out of them, that might ſerue vs in this our argument to any ſted at all. For although ſome things may be obſerued in the reading of Liuy, Valerius Maximus Polybius, Athenaeus, Polyaenus, Aelianus, Seneca, Stobaeus, Quintilian, Apuleius, Dion Pruiaeus, Maximus Tyrius, Theon Sophiſta, Plutarch in his treatiſe of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teins, and the Panegyricke made to Maxim. and Conſtant. yet thoſe doe rather ſeeme in my iudgement, to concerne his priuate life, naturall inclination, maners, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and vices, then this his voiage and expedition. Francis Iuret, in his annotations vpon Symmachus, doth confeſſe that he hath by him the life of Alexander the Great, written firſt in the Greeke tongue by one Aeſope, and ſince that tranſlated into Latine by Iulius Valerius. This authour as yet we haue nor ſeene, and therefore of him we ſay nothing. We haue therefore (in the deſcription of this Empire of the Macedonians, the greateſt, as Liuy in his fiue and fortieth booke nameth it, of all the whole earth, begunne by this our Alexander) performed what we could, not what we would. To this we haue cauſed the plot and portraiture of Iupiter Ammons o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, famous, as Pomponius Mela writeth, for the certainty of his predictions, to be adioined for an auctuarie and ornament; and for that it is ſo often named &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in all ancient hiſtories: as alſo for that this our Alexander in this his expedition, went vnto this place, to demand of the Oracle what the iſſue and euent of this his iourney ſhould be. Laſtly Curtins and Trogus do iointly affirme that he commanded that his body, after his death, ſhould heere be buried although it be certaine that this was not performed: for his corps was interred at Alexandria in Egypt. Of it therefore out of ſundrie authours we haue collected that which followeth.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>By that deſcription of Iupiter Ammon in Curtius, it ſeemeth that he meant to expreſſe vnto vs two formes of it: viz. one which was accounted to bee his image or counterfet, the other was that which was worſhipped for a god: that had the ſhape of a ramme, this the forme of a boſſe <hi>(vmbilicus)</hi> For I vnderſtand by the word <hi>vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicus,</hi> any high thing that ſteeketh out (as the nauil in a man) in maner of a pyramis, or conus round or ſquare: Like as in books almoſt finiſhed, as Porphyrius teſtifieth, they ordinarily vſed to doe either for ornament or ſome ſpeciall purpoſe; yea and yet to this day ſtill they are put vpon the outſide in forme of a round globe. For men of ancient families were wont, as we do gather by many circumſtances, oft times in this rude manner to point at their gods, rather then truely to expreſſe them in their true forme and proportion. In the temple of Delphos, as Strabo in the 6. booke of his Geography reporteth, there was a boſſe preſerued, curiouſly lapped vp in skarfes and ribbends, to demonſtrate and ſhew vnto the world, that this place was in <hi>Vmbilico,</hi> that is, in the middeſt or center of the whole earth: and it was made, as Pauſanias writeth, of pure white marble. For the ſtatue or image of the goddeſſe Venus, which was to be ſeene at Paphus in Cyprus, as Tacitus reporteth, was a continuall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, broad at the bottome, with a thinne edge or brim, riſing vp narrower and narrower by degrees, in manner of a pyrarnis. Maximus Tyrius in his 38. oration ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſame of it, almoſt word for word: but that he ſaith it was like a white pyramis. The ſame authour in the ſame place writeth, that the Arabians portraitured their god in forme of a ſquare or cubicall ſtone: and as Suidas affirmeth, it had no manner of carued worke vpon it at all. But this he ſpeaketh of the Arabians of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaea, and withall addeth that this their god is called Mars. Minutius Felix maketh the ſame god to be but a rough ſtone, vnhew'd or vnpoliſh't. Liuy alſo teſtifieth that the Peſſinuntij, a people in Phrygia, did honour a ſtone for the mother of the gods. Arnobius in his 6. booke ſaith that it was a flint ſtone, of no great bigneſſe, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour blacke or very darke and duskiſh, verie craggy, rough and vneuen. Prudentius alſo in his 7. booke ſaith, that it was of colour browne or inclining to blacke. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodianus reporteth almoſt the ſame of the forme of the ſtatue of the Sunne or Elagabalus, that Quintus Curtius doth of his god Ammon: Theſe are his words as you may read in his 5. booke: They haue no image carued and made by arte of man, after the manner of the Greekes or Romanes, to expreſſe the ſimilitude of that god: But there is a very great ſtone, round at the bottome, and tapred vpward almoſt in manner of that Geometricall body which the Mathematicians do call <hi>Conus.</hi> The Sicyonij, citizens of Sicyona city in Peloponneſus in Greece, as Pauſanias writeth, did make their Iupiter Milichius in forme of a pyramis or taper. The Semni, a ſect of Philoſophers in India, as Clemens Alexandrinus reporteth, did adore and do religious ſeruice to a pyramis. Hither peraduenture that ſigne of the profane Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament mentioned by Firmicus, is to be referred. Yea and the Romanes themſelues vnder this forenamed figure doubtleſſe did meane to expreſſe ſome god or other, as appeareth by that ſcaffold or chaire, deſcribed by the foreſaid Herodian, made in manner of a turret or lanterne, in which their Emperours were crowned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled, and was indeed of them enrowled amongſt the number of their gods or ſaints as you pleaſe to terme them. For this alſo was ſo built that it did riſe from the bottome vpward leſſe &amp; leſſe by degrees, vntil at length it came to the higheſt &amp; laſt roome, which was the leaſt and narroweſt of all. Hither alſo are to be referred thoſe obeliskes or pyramides of the Egyptians, built in forme not much vnlike thoſe <hi>Vmbilici,</hi> before mentioned, dedicated alſo to the Sunne. Item thoſe ſpires <hi>(metae)</hi> in the theaters dedicated to the Dioſcuri or Tyndarides. The fire (which ſignifieth the goddeſſe <hi>Veſta,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Eſta,</hi> the Chaldees call the fire) alſo was expreſſed in this forme, whoſe temple was built round, and tapered vpward. All which do come very neere to the forme of a boſſe <hi>(Vmbilicus)</hi> or that Geometricall body called by them <hi>Conus.</hi> Out of theſe I gather that the ancient reading in the old imprinted copies of Quintus Curtius, which haue <hi>Vmbilico ſimilis,</hi> like a boſſe, is much better and more probable, than that late edition ſet out the other day by a learned man, which readeth, <hi>Vmbilico tenus arieti ſimilis,</hi> to the nauill like a ramme. But all theſe will appeare more plaine and cleare to the reader by the compariſon of certaine monies and coines, as may be ſeene in thoſe authours which haue of purpoſe written of the ancient Romane coines. Moreouer certaine nations alſo (although this be not altogether to our purpoſe, yet I take it not amiſſe to adde a word or two of it, by the way) were woont to attribute no great beauty to their gods. For Arnobius writeth that the Scythians for the ſigne or idol of their god did vſe a skene or ſhort ſword. The The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpij, citizens of Theſpia, a city in Boetia in Greece, did adore and do diuine honour to a bough of Progne: The Romanes for Quirinus (or Romulus, as ſome thinke) to a ſpeare. The Samij did reuerence a well for Iuno: and the Carij, a rough and vnhewed peece of timber, for Diana. Pauſanias witneſſeth that the Sicyonij honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Diana Paetroa, vnder the forme of a columne or rude pillar rough and vnpoliſhed. Maximus Tyrius reporteth that the Celtae did do reuerence to a very high oke as vnto the ſigne or image of mighty Ioue. The ſame authour teſtifieth that the Paeones for the Sunne, did diuine honour to a little diſh or platter put vpon the toppe of a long pole. Tertullian telleth vs that Pallas Attica, and Ceres Farrea were put vpon the end of an ill-fauor'd pole, rugged ſtake or rough peece of wood. Faria, or Pharia, which Lipſius liketh better, to whom alſo I aſſent, for that in a certaine coine which Antonius Auguſtinus ſetteth out in his Dialogues, together with the image and picture of this goddeſſe, there is this inſcription ISIS PHARIA. ſeeing that alſo as Herodotus and Plutarch doe teſtifie, that this ſame goddeſſe is the ſame that Iſis, which is worſhipped of the Egyptian, is: item that Iſis is the ſame that Dea Peſſinuntia is, and this the ſame that Cybele. So that <hi>Pharia,</hi> as he would haue it, ſhould be the ſame with <hi>Aegyptia,</hi> vnderſtanding thereby Iſis of Aegypt. Moreouer Minutius Felix maketh mention of Pharia Iſis. Pauſanias in his Achaica writeth that in times paſt it was an ordinary thing generally practiſed by all the Grecians to worſhip rude and vnpoliſhed ſtones for their gods. Item, Herodotus in Clio doth writneſſe that the Perſians were not woont to make any images, to reare any temples or to build any altars to their gods. We read alſo that it was the cuſtome of ſome nations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to make any image, portraitures or pictures of their gods at all. For Tacitus writeth that the Syrians neuer made any ſimilitude or temple to their god Carmel, only they built him an altar, and did adore him with a religious worſhip. The ſame authour ſaith, That the Germanes did make no ſimilitudes of their gods: nor did euer attribute vnto them the ſhape and feature of any mortall man: and moreouer he addeth, that they did ſee them onely in their deuotions. Strabo ſaith that the Perſians did neither erect images nor altars to their gods. Silius Italicus ſpeaketh thus of the chappell of Hercules at Caliz: <hi>Sed nulla effigies, ſimulacráue nota Deorum, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſt ite locum &amp; ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ro impleuere timore.</hi> Yea and the Romanes themſelues, as Varro telleth the tale, for more then an hundred and fifty yeares together, did worſhip their gods without any images or idols at all. And indeed Pliny plainly affirmeth, that it is the weakeneſſe of mans nature to ſeeke for any ſimilitudes or counterfets of them. But becauſe there is nothing more abſolute and perfect than God, it is very probable that the Gentiles did reuerence him vnder that forme, wherewith in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they come to perfection, they are ordinarily beautified, as with a moſt rich and coſtly ornament. Why they vſed to carrie this god Ammon in a boate or pinnace, peraduenture we may vnderſtand by that of Cornelius Tacitus: where he teacheth that the Sueui were woont to make the image of Iſis in manner of a ſmall barke or pinnace: thereby to ſhew that their religion and manner of ſeruice of their gods vſed by them, was brought from beyond the ſea from forrein countries. Pauſanias hath left recorded that the Cyreneans did at Delphos dedicate their God Ammon ſitting in a waggon [<hi>Vehiculum,</hi> the interpreter calleth.] <hi>Sic bona poſteritas</hi> [Romana ſcilicet] <hi>Puppim formauit in aere, Hoſpitis aduentum teſtificata Dei.</hi> So Romanes old for loue did make This ſhippe, of pureſt braſſe, To teſtifie that this their god A farre borne ſtranger was: this Ouid in this firſt booke of his <hi>Faſti,</hi> ſpeaketh of the Romane god Ianus. So that what the Romanes meant by this their ſhippe, <hi>[puppis]</hi> that they meant by their pinnace or wagon <hi>[nauigium,</hi> or <hi>vehiculum.]</hi> Moreouer, amongſt the Germanes alſo in an iland of the maine ſea, as Tacitus teſtifieth, there was a place which he calleth <hi>Caſtum nemus,</hi> in which there was a waggon conſecrated and ſanctified, couered ouer with a cloth, and adored as a ſaint. But peraduenture we haue beene too tedious in this argument.</p>
               <p>As we haue out of old and ancient hiſtories laid downe two diuers and ſundry formes of this god Ammon; ſo out of the ſame it is very probable that hee had two diuers temples: For Diodorus in his ſeuenteenth booke in the deſcription of this temple, doth ſay that it was built by Danaus the Egyptian. And the ſame authour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in his firſt booke ſaith, that Ofiris alſo erected a temple for Iupiter Ammon, in Thebes a city in Egypt: which was all of beaten gold, cleane contrary to that which we haue deſcribed before, as appeareth out of theſe verſes of Lucane in his 9. booke: <hi>Non illic libyeae poſuerunt ditia gentes Templa, nec Eois ſplendent donariagemmis.</hi> In E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt it was, not in Libya, as is manifeſt out of the ſecond booke of Herodotus. Where you ſhall find this deſcription of it; Iupiter being not willing that Hercules, who came to viſit him, ſhould ſee him, yet at length by importunity being ouercome, vſed this deuice to deceiue him; He tooke a ram, flead him and cut off his head: this fell, with the head, wool and all, he put vpon him, and thus ſheweth himſelfe to Hercules. Wherupon the Egyptians haue decreed to make the image of Iupiter and to picture him with a rammes head.

            <p>But heere I cannot omit that which I haue read in <hi>Pauſanias</hi> his Phocica, namely, that certaine of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his conſorts, ſeuered and driuen from his company and the reſt of the nauy by ſtorme and tempeſt, did ſeat themſelues in the ile <hi>SARDINIA.</hi> Item, it is worth the obſeruation that <hi>Halicarnaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Liuy</hi> do iointly teſtifie, That <hi>Aeneas</hi> did not ſtay at <hi>Tibris,</hi> but at <hi>LAVRENTVM, (S. Laurentij,)</hi> and landed not with aboue ſixe hundred men, as <hi>Solinus</hi> reporteth: which indeed ſeemeth ſomewhat more probable and like to be true: for that both by ancient hiſtories and moderne experience, we finde that <hi>Tibris,</hi> the riuer which runneth by <hi>Rome,</hi> is not capable of a fleet or nauy of any bigneſſe. Therefore it is to be thought that the Poet fained this of his owne head, or els ſpake it in loue and commendations of this riuer. Neither was it a voyage of ſeuen yeeres, but of two at the moſt, as <hi>Halicarnaſſeus</hi> doth plainly affirme: <hi>Solinus</hi> out of <hi>Caſſius Hemina</hi> auoucheth the ſame. There are ſome, as <hi>Strabo</hi> in the thirteenth booke of his Geography witneſſeth, which do thinke all this voyage to be a fained tale and fiction of the Poets: and that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſtayed ſtill in <hi>Troy,</hi> and ſucceeded in the kingdome after his father, as likewiſe his childrens children did after him for many generations. Of this opinion <hi>Homer</hi> doth ſeeme to be. <hi>Xenophon</hi> in his booke of hunting, telleth this tale another way, where he writeth, That <hi>Aeneas</hi> manfully defending his father, and carefully preſeruing the gods of his father and mother, gat himſelfe a great reputation and credit amongst all ſorts of men, for that his piety and religion; inſomuch that euen the very enemies themſelues, granted to him only, aboue all other which they had taken captiue in the ſurprizing of <hi>Troy,</hi> that in the ſacking of the ſame no man ſhould ſpoile or lay hand of ought that was his. Moreouer, that that his voyage vnto <hi>Carthage</hi> is not mentioned by any approoued hiſtorian, but fained by the poet, <hi>Macrobius</hi> doth plainly teach. Item, <hi>Appian,</hi> a writer of good credit, doth much diſcredit that ſtory of his meeting and communication with Queene <hi>Dido,</hi> who writeth that <hi>CARTHAGE</hi> was built by the ſame <hi>Dido</hi> fiue hundred yeeres before the deſtruction of <hi>Troy.</hi> Againe, the graue hiſtoriographer <hi>Trogus,</hi> in his eighteenth booke doth make a relation of the life and death of this <hi>Dido</hi> or <hi>Eliza</hi> farre different from this. But the poet, as it ſeemeth, had a purpoſe to diſgrace this citie and to ſtrike a deepe impreſſion of the fatall hatred which it alwayes bare towards the Romans, like as long before, <hi>Homer</hi> vnder the perſon of <hi>Helen</hi> had ſhewed how much the Greeks in heart did malice the Troians. Whereupon not vnfitly, I thinke, this Epigram of <hi>Auſonius</hi> which he wrote vpon the counterfet or picture of Queene <hi>Dido</hi> may heere to thoſe former be adioined: <hi>Illa ego ſum</hi> Dido <hi>vultu, quam conſpicis hoſpes, Aſſimulata modis pulchra<expan>

            <head>The PEREGRINATION of VLYSSES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He manifold wandring voiages of Vlyſſes (<hi>Errores,</hi> Auſonius in diuers places calleth them) were from all antiquity ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowmed amongst all men, that <hi>The Peregrination of Vlyſſes,</hi> grew into a by-word, and to be ſpoken prouerbially of any hard and difficult trauell that any man did vndergoe, as Apuleius, in the ſecond booke of his Golden Aſſe, doth teſtifie. Therefore for the benefite of the Readers and Students of that hiſtory, and at the earneſt requeſt of ſundrie learned men, my friends, I haue thought good out of ancient Hiſtorians, to deſcribe the <hi>twenty voyages</hi> of this famous Captaine, who, as Tzetzes writeth, with <hi>twelue ſhippes,</hi> ſet forward from <hi>TROY,</hi> (or, as the Greekes call it, <hi>Ilium,</hi>) a city of Troia or Troas, a prouince of Aſia Minor, continually wandring vp and downe vntill at laſt he came to <hi>ITHACA,</hi> an iland in the Ionian ſea, where hee was borne, now called, as Sophianus and others do teſtifie, <hi>Valle di Compare,</hi> or <hi>Teachi,</hi> as Porcacchius affirmeth; but of the Turkes <hi>Phiachi,</hi> as Leunclaw witneſſeth. Therefore after the tenne yeares ſiege, taking and ſacking of Troy by the Greekes, <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> or <hi>Odyſſeus</hi> as they call him, hauing a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to returne home to his owne country, ſhipped himſelfe and his company, put foorth to ſea, and arriued within a few daies vpon the coaſt of the <hi>CICONES,</hi> a people of Thracia in Europe, whoſe chiefe city <hi>ISMARVS, (Zimarus,</hi> Dictys Cretenſis falſly calleth it) hee ſacked and ſpoiled. This city, as Suidas, Heſychius, and Tzetzes do teſtifie, was called <hi>MARONEA,</hi> now <hi>Marogna,</hi> as Sophianus and Niger both do peremptorily affirm, or, <hi>Marolia,</hi> as Leunclaw writeth. In Hyginus fables it is falſly written <hi>Marathonia.</hi> And that it ſhould be amended &amp; written Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronea, it is very manifeſt, for that the wine wherewithall Vlyſſes afterward made the great lubber Polyphemus drunk was fetched from hence, as hee there writeth, and which Euripides in his Cyclops doth iuſtifie to be true. Moreouer <hi>Vinum Maroneum,</hi> the wine of Maronea, hath beene in old time much eſteemed of and was as famous as any other ſort whatſoeuer. Therefore after the ſacke of this city, and as Suidas reporteth, Hecuba, ending her daies, neere the ſea, being there intombed in ſtone in a place commonly called by the name of <hi>CYNOSSEMA,</hi> he was aſſaulted by the Cicones a ſturdy and rough kind of people inhabiting amongst the mountaines of Thrace; and ſo by that meanes was forced with great loſſe and ſlaughter of his men to horſe ſaile and put off to ſea againe. And directing his courſe toward <hi>MALEA, (Cabo Malio,</hi> or <hi>S. Michaels wings)</hi> a promontory or foreland of Peloponneſus, the weather growing very foule, he was ſore troubled and his ſhips rent and torne moſt grieuouſly, as Homer teſtifieth. But first it is very probable that he put into <hi>DELOS (Sdiles)</hi> an iland in the Archipelago, lying directly in his way, and where they write, that before the altar of Apollo, Vlyſſes ſaw a tall and ſlender <hi>Palme-tree</hi> grow: which, Cicero in his booke of Lawes affirmeth, was ſtill to be ſeene in his time: and it is likely was the very ſame, which Pliny reporteth in his time had remained from the daies of Apollo. Homer alſo and Pauſanias do ſpeake of this palme tree. From <hi>Malea,</hi> he came to the ile <hi>CYTHERA (Cerigo)</hi> in the Ionian ſea not farre from the coaſt of Peloponneſus, and from thence he went to the <hi>LOTOPHAGI.</hi> The <hi>Lotophagi,</hi> a kind of people which liue eſpecially by the fruit of the lote tree, are by Hiſtoriographers placed in Africa, yea and that heere and there in diuerſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of the ſame. But thoſe Lotophagi vnto whom the conſorts of this our Vlyſſes came, I am of opinion with Iſaac Tzetzes, that they dwelt neere <hi>Hyperia,</hi> a city of Sicilia, or were next neighbours to <hi>Camarina,</hi> a city there ſtill knowen by the name of Camarana. Neither can I bee perſwaded that theſe Lotophagi are to be ſought for in Africa: ſeeing that it is apparant euen out of Homer himſelfe that the next day they went from the Lotophagi vnto the <hi>CYCLOPES,</hi> which out of Africa, ſo farre remote from Sicilia, they could by no meanes haue done. Item I haue Auſonius in his Periocha, vpon my ſide, who there teſtifieth that theſe Lotophagi did butte vpon the ile of the Cyclopes. Now almoſt all authours which haue written of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do iointly affirme that ſome of his conſorts, much delighted with the ſweetneſſe and pleaſant taſte of the fruit of the Lote tree, ſtaied heere ſtill and would by no meanes euer returne backe againe. This I thought good, gentle Reader, to admoniſh thee of, leſt thou ſhouldeſt in vaine in this our Mappe thinke to find any part of the continent of Africa. Moreouer in Pauſanias I reade, that Vlyſſes in this his iourney did build the <hi>ATHFNEVM,</hi> that is, the chapell of Minerua, in Arcadia. From <hi>Cythera,</hi> he went to <hi>CACRA,</hi> a porte towne of Sicilia, which the forenamed Tzetzes teſtifieth was of him afterward named <hi>Vlyſſis portus,</hi> Vlyſſes hauen, and had beene alſo ſometime called <hi>Engyon,</hi> now knowen by the name of <hi>Longina.</hi> From hence hee went to the <hi>ILE</hi> of the Cyclopes, and ſo to the <hi>CAVE</hi> of Polyphemus; where he offered ſacrifice and performed all due religious ceremonies vnto the gods, as Athenaeus teſtifieth. Now this <hi>Caue,</hi> as Vibius Sequeſter ſheweth, was vpon the brinke of the riuer Acis, now called <hi>Freddo.</hi> Heere making Polyphemus drunke with the forenamed Maronean wine, and putting out his eies, he went vnto the <hi>AEOLIAE,</hi> or, as the Gods call them, the <hi>Planetae,</hi> certaine ilands continually caſting foorth ſparkles and flames of fire. Heere of Aeolus, king of theſe ilands, he had giuen him a bottle or bagge made of an oxe skin, wherein all the winds, but Zephyrus the Weſt wind (or, if we may giue credit to Agatharchides, none but the North and South windes onely) were conteined and encloſed. For the Weſt wind for thoſe that ſaile with a ſtrait courſe from Sicilia to Ithaca, is the beſt that can blow. With this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous gale of wind, in nine daies, as Ouid reporteth, they comming within ſight and kenning of the ile Ithaca, while Vlyſſes was aſleepe, his conſorts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tenth day, as the foreſaid authour writeth, opened the bagge, which they had alwaies hitherto beene verily perſwaded was full of gold and ſiluer. By this meanes contrary winds and ſtormes ariſing, they are forced backe againe, and redoubling their courſe, (yet an ancient Lyricall Poet, ſaith it was but the bottle that went backe againe) to come the ſecond time to the <hi>AEOLIAN ILANDS:</hi> where being by Aelous, as contemners of the Gods, and skorners of all religion, for bidden to land, they came vnto the <hi>LAESTRYGONES,</hi> a ſauage people, that vſed to eat men, (like as they now write of the Canibals of America) who ſet vpon them, as enemies, neere to the city <hi>Lamus,</hi> and the fountaine <hi>Artacia.</hi> From hence with one ſhip onely (the other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuen, as Ouid and Auſonius do teſtifie, being ſunke by the Laeſtrygones) he came vnto the ile <hi>AE AE AE,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Circeia,</hi> (Hyginus in his fables doth falſly call <hi>Aena</hi>) the place of abode, where <hi>Circes,</hi> (called after her death, as Lactantius writeth, <hi>Marica</hi>) the daughter of Sol, or the Sunne, a woman famous for her Sorcery, paſſing skilfull in all maner of Magicke and witchcraft: by whoſe conduct and direction he went to <hi>AVERNVM,</hi> (Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drenus nameth it <hi>Neciopa</hi>) a lake in Italy now called <hi>Lago di Tripergola;</hi> where amongst the ſoules that are in Purgatory <hi>(apud Inferos)</hi> hee hath conference with his mother Anticlia, and of her and by her meanes he vnderſtood many things concerning his iourney that now he was to take. This done comming backe againe to <hi>Circeia,</hi> he found Elpenor one of his conſorts whom he had left with Circes, as alſo Tireſias the wiſard or ſooth-ſaier, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe other worthies and braue men, dead and buried. From thence he returned to the <hi>SVPERI,</hi> and entred there the <hi>Ocean.</hi> Laſtly, he made a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and performed all ceremonies as he had promiſed to do, for his friend Elpenor, and withall built him a ſtately tombe. And thus much of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Of this his nauigation through the vaſt Ocean, although many things by diuers authors are diuerſlie reported: (as of <hi>Vlyſſea,</hi> and <hi>Vlyſſipona,</hi> certaine cities of Spaine, &amp;c. built by this our Vlyſſes: Of an altar in <hi>Caledonia,</hi> mentioned by Solinus, a prouince of Great Britaine, hauing an inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption vpon it written in Greeke letters, there conſecrated and dedicated to ſome God whoſe gratious fauour he had largely taſted of in this his iourney: Of <hi>Aſciburgium,</hi> a city built by him, as Tacitus writeth, vpon the brinke of the riuer Rheine, and of an altar there conſecrated to his ſeruice:) yet that they are altogether fained and meere fables, there be many things that do ſtrongly proue. And indeed Aulus Gellius, in the ſixth chapter of his foureteenth booke, ſheweth, that long ſince this voiage vpon the Ocean ſeas was doubted of and called in queſtion: videlicet, they made a queſtion whether Vlyſſes wandred through the maine Ocean, as Ariſtarchus would haue it: or whether he neuer went out of the inner ſea, (ſo Strabo and Pliny do call the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terran or Midland ſea) as Cratetes would perſwade vs. And truely in Auſonius his Periocha there is not a word of this nauigation through the Ocean. Item, Vlyſſes himſelfe relating vnto his wife the ſumme of all his peregrination, doth not once name the Ocean. Neither doth Dares Phrygius, Hyginus in his fables, or Iſacius vpon Lycophron, mention any ſuch thing: and yet euery one of theſe men doe make a large diſcourſe of that his wandring voiage. Againe thoſe things which we find in Strabo of this matter, as he himſelfe plainly confeſſeth, were taken out of Poſſidonius, Artemidorus, and Aſclepiades (euery one of which authours it is certaine liued many a day ſince Homer) and not out of Homer himſelfe. Item, the wiſe Seneca in the <hi>88.</hi> chapter of his ſeuenth booke, calleth it <hi>Anguſtum iter &amp; errorem longum,</hi> A ſhort iourney, but long in regard of many turne-againes, before it was ended. But becauſe it was alſo before me, by the learned Iohn Brodey, a man of good iudgement and quicke conceit, accounted for a meere fable, I will heere, out of the third booke of his Miſcellanea, ſet downe his opinion in his owne words, which in Engliſh are thus: They, ſaith he, who thinke that Vlyſſes euer ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon the Maine Ocean, do labour to prooue that their opinion, out of this verſe of Homer, in the tenth booke of his Odyſſes, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <pb facs="tcp:23194:315"/> Vlyſſes ſhippes deſcribed by Homer, to be open, without deckes and hatches, I doe perceiue them to haue beene much too weake and too low, to abide the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and ſtormes of the maine ſea: which for three moneths of the yeare galleies and tall ſhippes, well and ſtrongly built of the beſt timber, and well ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned can hardly be able to ſuſtaine. That any man ſhould thinke that Aſtypyrgium, (or, Aſciburgium, which wee ſpake of a little before) was built by Vlyſſes, as ſome men haue gathered out of Cornelius Tacitus, it were extreame madneſſe. For if one would paſſe the Spaniſh, French and Engliſh ſeas, and then at length to returne backe againe through the Germane Ocean, and in diuers places, on Gods name, vpon the ſea coaſt to build and erect altars, he had need haue a nauy of many tal ſhips ſtrongly built &amp; wel appointed, he muſt not think to do it with one little bark or rotten barge rowed to &amp; fro with oares and ſtrength of men. But authours of good credit do make mention of Vlyſſipo, and of other famous monuments of him to be ſeene in Portugall. What then? Whether that any thing of Vlyſſes his doing be there to be ſeene or euer were I greatly doubt: and if there be, yet that it was made by this Vlyſſes, whoſe life &amp; famous acts Homer did deſcribe, I flatly deny. And yet it is not incredible to beleeue, that as we do ſuppoſe that there were many Herculeſſes, ſo that there were in like maner more Vlyſſeſſes then one: which in mine opinion ſeemeth very probable and likely to be true. Thus farre Brodey. To thoſe arguments of his I adde, firſt, That Odyſſopolis is; by Cedrenus and the Hiſtoria Miſcella, deſcribed, to be neere Pontus in Aſia. And who is ſo madde to beleeue that this city was ſo named of this our Odyſſus or as the Latines call him Vlyſſes? And ſeeing that I do ſee that Homer himſelfe doth not make mention of any one place vnto the which he did put in or landed in all this his trauel vpon the Ocean ſea: I am eaſily perſwaded that this notable Poet doth, not only in this verſe, but euen in diuers other places alſo by the Ocean, poetically mean the ſea. For example, neere the end of the <hi>10.</hi> book of his Odyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes &amp; ni the beginning of the <hi>11.</hi> aſſoone as euer he is returned from the <hi>Inferi,</hi> preſently Homer maketh him to enter the Ocean. But you will ſay he entred the Ocean, neere wherabout the <hi>Cimmerij</hi> did dwell, as appeareth plainly by that which he writeth in the beginning of the <hi>12.</hi> book of his Odyſſes: True. But where I pray you, did theſe <hi>Cimmerij</hi> dwell? No where ſurely, but in Italy, within a little of the ile Circeia, &amp; being returned from thence, he burieth, according to his promiſe, the body of Elpenor. The body I mean, after ſo many moneths, or, which is more probable, ſo many yeres (for thoſe nauigations in old time were not the next way through the middeſt of the ſea, but much further about, as we haue ſhewed in our Theſaurus at the word <hi>OPHIR,</hi> along by the ſhore within ſight of land) corrupt, or, which is more likely turned to duſt and aſhes, or quite conſumed to nothing. If any man ſhall againe obiect (with Ouid in the firſt booke of his Triſtium, who ſaith that <hi>illius pars maxima ficta laborum eſt:</hi> The moſt part of Vlyſſes toile, was forged in Poets braine) and ſay that this whole hiſtory, and not only this nauigation vpon the Maine Ocean, was but a feined tale. I anſwer, that all the ſtory, except this part of his nauigation by the vaſt Ocean only, is ſomewhat probable, and nothing in it impoſſible but might haue beene done. In this voiage by the Ocean ſea, I haue ſtated the longer, leſt the Reader might ſuſpect that either through negligence or ignorance it were left out in this our Mappe. Now let vs, if you pleaſe, go on forward with our intended iourney. Vlyſſes departing from the iland <hi>Aeaea,</hi> and taking his leaue of his hoſteſſe Circes, by whom, hauing kept with her by the ſpace of an whole yeare, he begat his ſonne Telegonus, he went his way ſafe and ſound. For Mercury had giuen him the hearb <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (ſo the Gods do call it) a ſure antidote and preſeruatiue againſt all maner of inchantments and witchcraft. And ſailing along by the <hi>SIRENVM IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVLAE, (the Mirmaides ilands)</hi> he built the temple of Minerua <hi>(Fanum Mineruae)</hi> in <hi>CAMPANIA</hi> in Italy, as Strabo writeth. In this tract alſo, videlicet, in <hi>LVCANIA,</hi> as the ſame authour recordeth, he built the chapell of Draco <hi>(Sacellum Draconis)</hi> one of his companions in that his voiage. From thence he ſailed along by the ſhore, and at length landed at <hi>TENESSA,</hi> a city of the Bruttij; (Iſacius vpon Lycophronfalſly writeth, that he landed in England, miſtaking <hi>Britannos,</hi> for <hi>Bruttios,</hi> or ignorantly confounding <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>:) as Pauſanias hath left recorded: Item, Suidas out of Pauſanias affirmeth the ſame, but withall he addeth that heere one of the ſailers did rauiſh a virgin, and for that vild act was by the towneſmen ſtoned to death. Neere to this towne the chapell of Politas, <hi>(Fanum Politae)</hi> one of Vlyſſes conſorts, by Strabo is deſcribed to haue ſtood. From hence it is likely out of Pliny, that he came to the iles <hi>ITHACEIAE,</hi> or, as otherwiſe they are called, <hi>Vlyſſes ſpecula,</hi> that is, Vlyſſes beacon or lanterne. From hence ſetting forward, and warily auoiding the dangerous <hi>Scylla,</hi> and <hi>Charybdes,</hi> (although not altogether without the loſſe of ſome of his company) he came againe into <hi>TRINACRIA,</hi> or the Iland of the Sunne, <hi>(Inſula Solis)</hi> twiſe, as Horace ſaith, or as Auſonius writeth, often loſing his way, and failing of his courſe: where while he himſelfe was aſleep, ſome of his company killed certaine ſheep of Sol, the gouernour of that place, out of his flocke, which, as Appianus Alexandrinus in the fifth booke of his Ciuill warres writeth, did feed neere Artemiſium, a towne in Sicilia, which Barrius at this day thinketh to be called <hi>Agatha:</hi> for which their villanie and foule act committed by them, they were all caſt away and ſunke. Vlyſſes himſelfe alone, getting vp vpon the maſt of the ſhip, eſcaped and was carried into the ile <hi>OGYGIA,</hi> where hee dwelt ſeuen yeares, as Homer writeth, or ſix yeare, as Ouid teſtifieth: or tenne yeares, as Seruius would make vs beleeue, with the Nymph Calypſo, by whom he gate his ſonne Auſon. After all this, building a ſhip with his owne hands, he ſhippeth himſelfe and ſetteth ſaile all alone, for meere naturall loue of his country (preferring it before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, which the goddeſſe had promiſed if ſo be he would ſtay with her) committing himſelfe to the ſea, out alas he feeleth againe the ſecond time the waight of Neptunes wrath, for that, as we haue ſhewed before, he had put out the eies of his ſonne Polyphemus. For the eighteenth (or, as Ouid writeth, the eightith) day after his firſt ſetting out, when as he came ſo neere Ithaca, that he might eaſily deſcry the ſmoke of the chimneies (mark the croſſe lucke) tempeſtuous winds and raging ſtormes do on euery ſide ariſe, ſo that his ſhip was ouerturned, and himſelfe throwen into the ſea, but, as God would haue it, riſing againe inſtantly he caught hold of the ſhip. The Nymph Leucothea, (<hi>Nauſicaa,</hi> others call her) ſeeing him thus toiled and wandring in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the ſea, tooke compaſſion vpon him, and preſently relieued him: ſhe aduiſeth him to let go the ſhip, to put off his apparell, and to commit himſelfe naked to the ſea only; and withall ſhe giueth him her fillet or haire-lace wherewith her head was bound vp: which he tying about his middle, ſwom vntill he came vnto the country of the <hi>PHAEACES,</hi> (Cedrenus, falſly, hath Phoenices) where he arriued neere vnto the riuer Callirhoë. The foreſaid Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drenus writeth that he was carried from hence into <hi>Creta</hi> to Idomeneus; and by him conuieghed thence into <hi>Corcyra,</hi> vnto Alcinous. But let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. With this fillet of Leucothea, he being tied vnto the ſhip and hanging at it, (except heere Philoſtratus which is ordinary with him, doe tell a tale,) with his owne ſtrength, vſing his hande in ſteed of oares, he ſwomme through the middeſt of the ſea. Yet that the ſhippe came thus farre and further, it ſeemeth out of Pliny to be not altogether improbable: becauſe he writeth that about Phalacrum, a promontory or foreland of Phaeacia, or Corcyra, this ſhip was turned into a rocke: which rocke Martianus ſaith is in faſhion and proportion like a ſhip: although falſly hee in that place calleth this foreland Phalarium for Phalacrum. But if any man ſhall ſay that he doth requite one tale with another, I will not greatly gainſay him. From Phaeacia, by Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous king of that country, who had moſt honourably intertained him, he was at length conueighed to <hi>Ithaca</hi> his natiue country, whoſe ſmoake he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times and often deſired before this to ſee. Where killing the woers, which were in number, if one may beleeue Athenaeus, an hundred and eight, or as Dictys Cretenſis ſaith but thirty onely, he embraceth and kindly ſaluteth his louing wife Penelope. And this is the end of all theſe wandring peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which, as Ouid ſaith, <hi>Iactatus dubio per duo luſtra mari:</hi> Tenne yeares he wandred vp and downe in ſeas vnknowen. Signifying that the reſt of the yeares were ſpent in trauels and troubles endured vpon the land. Of which the ſame authour alſo thus ſpeaketh, <hi>Ille breui ſpatio multis errauit in annis, Inter Dulichias Iliacaſ<expan>

Iſacius vpon Lycophron teſtifieth that Vlyſſes, by the counſell of Minerua, went to <hi>TRAMPYA,</hi> a city of the Eurytanes, a people of Epyrus or Aetolia, there to offer ſacrifice vnto the Gods: and withall this our authour there addeth, that theſe people are the very ſame that Homer in the eleuenth booke of his Odyſſes ſpeaketh of in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, vntill hee came amongst thoſe men, that ne'r heard tell of Ocean ſea. Againe the ſame authour moreouer affirmeth that in this city Vlyſſes was worſhipped as a god, and that hee had an oracle there. Not farre from hence amongst theſe people alſo Stephanus placeth the city <hi>BVNIMA,</hi> firſt founded by Vlyſſes. That he was reuerenced as a god, I do find by a certaine ſpeech of Seneca that he vſeth of him vnto Serenus: and therefore it is no maruell that he ſhould giue foorth anſwers and oracles. And that I may omit nothing of his labours, Dares Phrygius amongst diuers other of his dangerous attempts writeth that hee put in to harborough at <hi>MONVCHA.</hi> Caſſiodorus in the twelfth booke of his <hi>Variar.</hi> writeth that the towne <hi>SCYLLACIVM</hi> was alſo built by him. That he erected a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vpon the toppe of mount <hi>BOREVS</hi> in Peloponneſus, to Neptune and Minerua Soſpita, I do find in Pauſanias his: Arcadica. Apollodorus, as Strabo citeth, writeth that Vlyſſes in this his voiage came to the ile <hi>CANNVS,</hi> but which this ſhould be I know not. For of this name there are diuers, as thou ſhalt find in our Theſaurus. And peraduenture it is not vnlikely to be true, that Vlyſſes was toſſed to and fro to diuers and ſundry places; which Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſthenes, as Strabo alledgeth, ſaith he will then find out, when it ſhalbe his chance to meet with the cobler which ſewed the bottell wherein he carried the windes which Aeolus gaue him. And thus much generally of the wandring voiage of this Captaine, which happened to him as he paſſed <hi>inter Dulichi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Iliacaſque domos,</hi> Betweene the iland Zante and famous Troy, as Ouid reporteth. <hi>Sed perlege Odyſſeam omnia noſſe volens,</hi> But read o're learned Homers workes, He telleth this tale at large: as Auſonius in his Epitaphs counſelleth. Yet of this our Vlyſſes I cannot with ſilence paſſe ouer that of Plutarch in his Morals; namely, for that he had killed thoſe Suters, it was by Neoptolemus decreed againſt him that hee muſt leaue his country and be ſeene no more in Ithaca, Dulichium and Zacynthus. So that in this his baniſhment he went againe into <hi>Italy.</hi> But where he left his life, it is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
<pb facs="tcp:23194:315"/> Iſacius vpon Lycophron, an authour oft cited by vs, affirmeth out of Theopompus, that hee died in <hi>GORTYNIA,</hi> a city of Tyrrhenia in Italy. Yet Dictys Cretenſis toward the latter end of his ſixth booke (whom alſo thou maieſt read if thou thinkeſt good) ſaith, that he died in <hi>ITHACA.</hi> All men for the moſt part generally report, that he was ſlaine vnawares by his ſonne Telegonus (holding ſtill in his hand a cuppe, as Athenaeus telleth the tale) with an iron dart, headed by his mother Circe, with a puffens quill <hi>(paſtinaca marina,</hi> they call it) but for another purpoſe, as Oppianus in the ſecond booke of his Halieutica writeth, namely to kill his enemy, not his father. Hyginus in the <hi>127.</hi> fable recordeth that aſſoone as he was dead hee was carried into the ile Aeaeato Circe, and was there by her interred. Some there are, as Iſacius teſtifieth, that do report that Circe by her ſorceries reſtored him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his former life. More peraduenture might haue beene ſaid of this our Vlyſſes, if Cratinus Comicus, whom Athenaeus reporteth to haue written <hi>De Vlyſſibus,</hi> were now extant and to be gotten. Notwithſtanding, after this larger diſcourſe of the wandring voyage of this famous Captaine, I thinke it not amiſſe to ſpeake a word or two of Vlyſſes himſelfe, becauſe I verily perſwade my ſelfe that it cannot but bee a matter that the Reader will very well like of. In a certaine ſiluer coine or piece of money of Caius Mamilius Limetanus, who, as the report goeth, (thus teſtifieth Liuy) was lineally deſcended from Vlyſſes, and the goddeſſe Circe, was ſtamped vpon one ſide the head of Mercury, and therefore it had, as is very probable, on the other ſide the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net or counterfet of Vlyſſes: which may be eaſily prooued out of thoſe particulars and teſtimonies that doe heereafter follow. Plutarch in the life of Cato the Elder, doth giue out that Vlyſſes had a purpoſe to haue gone backe againe to the caue of Polyphemus, for no other cauſe but to demand his Cappe and Girdle, which there he had left behind him &amp; forgotten. Therfore, it is here hence apparant that he did vſually weare a Cap and a Girdle. Yet we reade in Pliny that Nicomachus the painter did firſt paint Vlyſſes with a cappe vpon his head. And to be painted wearing a Cappe was a cogniſance and badge of nobility, as Soranus in the life of Hippocrates doth plainly affirme: item, Dion Pruſaeus in his foureteenth oration ſeemeth to intimate as much. Again, by an ancient cuſtome of the old Romanes they were woont by putting on a Cappe vpon a mans head, to make thoſe that were ſlaues, free. Whereupon they vſed this phraſe of ſpeech <hi>Ad pileum vocare,</hi> To call a man to the Cappe, for <hi>Ad libertatem vocare,</hi> To make one a freeman. That this Cappe af Vlyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was in faſhion round, it is manifeſt out of theſe words of Saint Hierome, <hi>Rotundum pileolum, quale in Vlyſſeo conſpicimus,</hi> A round Cappe, ſuch a like one as we do ſee vpon the counterfet of Vlyſſes. I may alſo adde this one thing although ſomewhat farre fetched, That they were called <hi>Pileati,</hi> as Iornandes teſtifieth, which amongst the Goths were accounted of greater birth and nobility, or of deeper reach and experience then the common ſort of men were of, becauſe they went with their heads couered with a kinde of bonnet or cappe. Moreouer he carried in his hand a ſtaffe, wherewith he ſtaid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe where the waies were ſlippery, and defended himſelfe from ſuch as in his trauell did aſſault or moleſt him; as Homer teſtifieth of him in the fourteenth booke of his Odyſſes. He had alſo a dog, as the ſame authour affirmeth, which after twenty yeares abſence, at his returne home knew his maſter. Now the name of this dogge, as we read in the ſame authour, was Argus. Which alſo Plutarch, in his booke of the tranquillity of the mind, doth auouch to be true. And withall addeth this moreouer, that he wept for his dogge when he died. Pauſanias in his <hi>Phocicis,</hi> deſcribeth this our Vlyſſes with a corſlet or coat-armor vpon his backe. Homer in the fifteenth booke of his Odyſſes ſaith that he was bald or very thinne haired. Which is to be vnderſtood of his latter daies when he grew in yeares. For Suidas out of the aforeſayd authour ſheweth, that his haire was blacke and curled. Beſide that, he ſaith that he was ſomewhat hog-backed or ſtoup-ſhouldred. That he bare in his ſhield or ſcutcheon a Dolphin, and why, thou maiſt read in Plutarch in his book of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of liuing creatures. But ſome man may aske me, why Mercury, wearing a broad brimmed hatte, with his verge or mace in his hand, was ſtamped vpon the backeſide of Vlyſſes coine? If it be lawfull for me to geſſe and interpoſe mine opinion, I anſwer, For the eſpeciall and ſingular loue and fauour of this God aboue the reſt, ſhewed at ſundrie times toward this braue Captaine. For when in that his peregination all the Gods well neere were ſet and oppoſed againſt him, only Mercury was found to fauour him and to ſticke cloſe vnto him. For he only gaue him an antidote or preſeruatiue againſt the ſorceries and inchantments of the miſchieuous witch Circe. And indeed we read that this God of all others was wont eſpecially to be honoured in any maner of magicall ſeruices whatſoeuer, as we may ſee in the fourth booke of Papirius his Thebaidos. Item, of this God he obtained leaue to depart, and that he might bee no longer detained by the nymph Calypſo &amp;c. And peraduenture there may be alſo another cauſe aſſigned; namely for that Vlyſſes, whom Homer and other authours do highly commend for a moſt eloquent oratour, and one that could ſpeake moſt wiſely and to the purpoſe in any kind of matter, did take this god Mercury (whom the Gentiles did make the preſident of orators and eloquence) for his guardian and protector, thinking thereby to bind him ſo much the more neerely vnto him. Pauſanias ſaith that in <hi>Motya,</hi> a city of Sicilia there was the ſtatue or counterfet of this our Vlyſſes, but by Nero the Emperour it was from thence tranſported to Rome in Italy. And thus much of this braue Captaine, <hi>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit &amp; vrbes,</hi> who, as the Poet writeth of him, ſaw many mens maners and knew many cities. Of whom alſo thus ſpeaketh Ouid, <hi>Si minùs erraſſet, notus minùs eſſet Vlyſſes?</hi> If great Vlyſſes had not ſtrai'd, he had beene more obſcure. But of him I will ſpeake no more: leſt peraduenture with the Grammarians, I bee hit in the teeth with that of Diogenes: who ſaid that while they did ſearch diligently to know all the croſſes and euils that befell Vlyſſes, did forget their owne. And moreouer that worthy admonition of wiſe Seneca, where he ſaith, <hi>Quid proderit inquirere vbi Vlyſſes errauerit, quàm ne nos ſemper erremus?</hi> What ſhall it auaile vs to ſeeke where and which way Vlyſſes wandred, more then to reſtraine vs that we do not in like maner alwaies wander as he did? And now it is high time to take penne from paper. As for thoſe coines which we haue ſpoken of before, I wiſh thee to repaire to Goltzius and others which haue at large and peculiarly handled that argument.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ARE ERYTHRAEVM,</hi> or, as the Latines call it, <hi>MARE RVBRVM, The Red Sea,</hi> which heere we offer to thy view in this Mappe, for as much as we can gather out of ancient writers, ſtretcheth it ſelfe from the Weſt, as Liuy writeth along by the coaſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica or Aethiopia, euen vnto India in Eaſt, yea and beyond that, I know not how farre, as Arrianus teſtifieth: whereupon Ptolemey, Pliny and Melado call it <hi>MARE INDICVM, The Indian Sea.</hi> But Herodotus calleth it <hi>MARE PERSICVM, The Perſian Sea.</hi> Which Pliny doth ſeeme to iuſtifie to be true, where he ſaith, That the Perſians do dwell along by the coaſt of the Red Sea, between the coaſt of Africa, and the iland Taprobana. Strabo that worthy Geographer, he calleth it <hi>MARE MAGNVM, The Great ſea,</hi> who moreouer doth affirme it to be a part of the Atlanticke ſea, and that truly. A part of this ſea, to wit, where it toucheth the coaſt of that Aethiopia which lieth beneath Aegypt, Pliny, of the countrie Azania (which at this day ſome do thinke to bee called <hi>Xoa</hi>) nameth it <hi>MARE AZANIVM.</hi> Where it ioineth with the Bay of Arabia, it is of Ptolemey named <hi>HIPPADIS PELAGVS,</hi> now called of ſome <hi>Archiplago di Maldiuar.</hi> Item, of the ſame Ptolemey it is otherwiſe called <hi>BARBARICVS SINVS, The Barbarian bay:</hi> I meane in that place where it beateth vpon Aethiopia, and the iland Menutheſia, now of the ſeamen generally called, <hi>The iland of Saint Laurence,</hi> but of that country people <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> and of Theuet <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra.</hi> There are two Baies or Gulfes, as the Italians and Spaniards terme them, of this ſea much talked of in all ancient hiſtories: to wit, <hi>SINVS PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SICVS, The Perſian Bay,</hi> and <hi>SINVS ARABICVS, The Arabian Bay,</hi> which ſome, not well read in old writers, do for the moſt part call <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Rubrum,</hi> The Red Sea. Very improperly, being indeed but a part of that ſea, properly called the Red ſea, which we haue hitherto ſpoken of. But why it was of the Greekes named <hi>Erythraeum,</hi> and of the Latines <hi>Rubrum,</hi> Red, it is a great queſtion amongst the learned not yet decided. Some there are which do deeme it to haue beene called, The Red Sea, of the colour of the water: but this, of all late writers, trauellers, ſeamen, and other eie-witneſſes of good credit, which haue in this our age, &amp; euery day do ſaile through this Sea, &amp; haue diligently viewed the ſame, is improued and found to be altogether falſe. Moreouer Qu. Curtius amongst the ancients doth plainly teſtifie that it differeth no whit in colour from other ſeas. Some there are as Pliny writeth, which do thinke that, by reaſon of the reuerberation of the Sunne beames, it ſeemeth to caſt vp ſuch a like colour to the ſight of the beholders. Others doe thinke that this is cauſed by reaſon of the colour of the ſand or earth in the bottom of the ſame: others do affirm it to be the very nature of the water. Some do write that it was ſo named of king Erythrus, Perſeus ſonne, whoſe tombe, as Quintus Curtius writeth, did in his time remaine in a certaine iland of this ſea not farre diſtant from the maine land: (Strabo calleth this iland, <hi>Tyrina:</hi> Pliny and Pomponius Mela, <hi>Ogyris:</hi> Arrianus, <hi>Oaracta:</hi>) or elſe of a certaine Perſian named Erythras, as the forenamed Strabo giueth out. Who, as Pliny with him teſtifieth, in a ſmall barke or barge firſt ſailed through this ſea and diſcouered the ſame. Which ſtory alſo is at large handled by Agatarchides. Yet our authour calleth him Hippalus, who firſt found out the courſe to ſaile through the middeſt of this ſea. Pliny by that name calleth the wind by which they make their iourneis through this ſea. (So called as is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable of the inuentour.) Which wind the ſame authour in the thirteenth chapter of his <hi>6.</hi> booke, maketh the ſame that Fauonius is vnto the Latines. Mela &amp; Agatarchides do call it a tempeſtuous, ſtormy, rough and deepe ſea. Pliny, Philoſtratus, Elianus, &amp; Athenaeus do giue it the title of <hi>Margaritife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23194:316"/> the pearle-bearing ſea. And the ſame Pliny maketh it <hi>Arboriferum,</hi> a tree-bearing ſea. For he writeth in the fiue and twentieth chapter of his thirteenth booke, that it is full of groues and tall woods: the toppes of whoſe high trees he affirmeth are ſeene much aboue the waters, and therfore at high tide they vſe to faſten their ſhippes vnto the toppes, and at the ebbe vnto the roots of the ſame. Item, the ſame authour, in the two and twentieth chapter of the ſixth booke of his Naturall hiſtorie, writeth that about Colaicum, (which alſo is called Colchi) or as Solinus affirmeth about Tapobrana, an iland not farre hence, the ſea is of a very greeniſh colour, and ſo full of trees that their toppe boughes are barked and bruſhed with the rudders or ſterne of thoſe ſhips that ſaile this way. Moreouer that trees do grow in this ſea Megaſthenes, out of Antigonus <hi>de Mirabilibus,</hi> doth affirme, which Plutarch in his Naturall queſtions, and againe in his booke <hi>de facie Lunae,</hi> doth auouch to be true: where he doth particularly nominate ſome of them, to wit, Oliue-trees, Bay-trees, and Plocamus, which otherwiſe they call Iſidis Capillus. This alſo Strabo in the ſixth booke of his Geography iuſtifieth to be true: ſo doth the forenamed Pliny, who teacheth vs that it is a plant much like to corall without leaues. Agatarchides ſaith that it reſembleth much the blacke ruſh. Athenaeus out of Philonides the Phyſician writeth, that the vine was firſt brought from the Redde-ſea and planted in Greece. In the eigth chapter of the fourth booke of Theophraſtus his hiſtory of plants, you may reade of diuerſe other kinds of trees and herbs which do naturally grow in this ſea. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius ſheweth, that this ſea hath more and greater monſters that do liue and breed in it then any other ſea in the world beſide. Quintus Curtius affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that it is full of whales, <hi>(balaenae)</hi> of ſuch an huge bigneſſe that they are in bulke equall to the greateſt ſhippes or veſſels that are. Solinus ſaith that one of them will couer two akers of ground. The ſame authour doth there deſcribe vnto vs certaine blew wormes, which haue their forelegges not leſſe then ſix foot long. Theſe are of that wonderfull ſtrength that oft times they do with their clawes lay hold vpon Elephants comming thitherto drinke, and by maine force pull them into the ſea. Item, he telleth of certaine whirle-pooles, <hi>Phyſeteras,</hi> he calleth them, of that huge bigneſſe, that they are to ſee to like vnto great and maſſie columnes, theſe doe many times raiſe themſelues vp as high as the croſſe-maſt, from whence they ſpout out ſuch abundance of water out of their gullets, that oft times by the violence of the ſtorme the veſſels of thoſe which ſaile and paſſe by that way are ſunke and caſt away. Strabo hath left in writing, that Amazenas, the admirall of the Indian fleet, did there ſee a whale of fifty foot in length. Arrianus in his Indica deſcribeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>balaenas,</hi> whales or whirlepooles, of an huge and wonderfull bigneſſe, with three ſorts of great and terrible kind of Serpents, which as Solinus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth will couer more then two akers of lands. It is recorded by Pliny that the Hydri, certaine ſea-monsters of twenty cubites in length, did much affright the nauy of Alexander the Great. Item, he telleth of torteiſes of ſuch a maruellous bigneſſe, that the ſhell of one of them will make a couer for a prettie houſe: and againe, That they vſually do ſaile in theſe ſhels vpon this ſea, like as they vſe in other countries in ſhippes and boates. Yea, as Agatarchides affirmeth, theſe fiſhes do ſerue thoſe which dwell vpon this ſea coaſt, inſtead of houſes, boats, diſhes and meat. About the iland Taprobana, now called as generally all learned do thinke, Samotra, there are certaine fiſhes, which do liue partly vpon ſea and partly vpon land, whereof ſome are like oxen, others like horſes, and other ſome are like other foure footed beaſts, as Strabo in his fifteenth and ſixteenth bookes hath left recorded. And thus much of the name, ſituation and nature of this Redde-ſea, which Liuy in his <hi>45.</hi> booke tearmeth, <hi>Finem terrarum,</hi> The outmoſt bound of the world. He that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to know more of this ſea, let him haue recourſe to Agatarchides and Arrianus in his Indica. Item, let him conſult with Baptiſta Ramuſio, who tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated this <hi>Periplus,</hi> or diſcouery, into the Italian tongue, and hath enlarged the ſame with a diſcourſe, as hee calleth it, of his owne, of the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I would wiſh him not to omit Stuckius, who alſo tranſlated the ſame into the Italian tongue, and hath illuſtrated it with his moſt learned and laborious Commentaries. Laſtly, Athenaeus in the fourteenth booke of his Deipnoſophiſton, maketh me beleeue that Pythagoras that great and famous Philoſopher, did write a booke of the Redde ſea.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Periplus of Hanno king of Carthage, was firſt tranſlated out of Greeke into Latine by Conradus Geſnerus, a man that hath very well deſerued of all ſorts of ſcholars &amp; ſuccedent ages, &amp; hath illuſtrated the ſame with his moſt learned and painfull Commentaries. But before him Baptiſta Ramuſio turned it into the Tuſcane tongue, and hath to it adioined a diſcourſe, as he termeth it. Of the ancient writers Pomponius Mela in the ſecond chapter of his third booke, &amp; Pliny in the firſt chapter of the fift book of his hiſtory of Nature, who there calleth him a captaine of Carthage, not king of Cathage, haue made mention of this Periplus or Diſcouery. But he calleth this diſcourſe by the name of Commentaries, not of a Periplus. The ſame Pliny in the one and thirtieth chapter of his ſixth booke calleth him an Emperour. Yet Solinus in the laſt chapter of his worke, out of Xenophon Lampſacenus, maketh as if hee had beene a king of the Poeni. Arrianus alſo toward the latter end of his Indian ſtories mentioneth this Periplus. Moreouer Pliny in the ſixteenth chapter of the eighteenth booke of his Naturall hiſtorie, and Aelianus in the fiftieth chapter of his fifth booke <hi>De Animalibus,</hi> do make mention of one Hanno, who was the firſt man that euer was heard of in the world that durſt handle, and take vpon him to tame a Lion. But whether he be the ſame with this our Hanno, I am not able to determine. For there haue beene many of that name: of which, if any man be deſirous to know more, let him repaire to the Commentaries of the forenamed Geſner, which he wrot vpon this Periplus. Theſe words in Pliny and Martianus in very deed are meant of another Hanno, diuers from this of whom wee haue hitherto ſpoken. Hanno, ſay they, at ſuch time as the Punicke Empire ſtood in flouriſhing eſtate, ſailed round about by the coaſt of Barbary, and ſo from thence South-ward all along by the ſhore, vntill at length after a long and tedious iourney he came to the coaſts of Arabia. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer that ſtudent that is deſirous to know more of this Periplus or Diſcouery, may adde to theſe collections of ours, ſuch things as Iohn Mariana hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of it, in the latter end of his firſt booke of his hiſtory of Spaine.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing admoniſhed in my ſleepe by the Goddeſſe <hi>Feſſonia,</hi> (which they were wont to adore and pray vnto, that by reaſon of any great labour or farre trauell were faint and weary <hi>(feſsi)</hi> that after this long and tedious peregrination ouer the whole world, I ſhould bethinke my ſelfe of ſome place of reſt, where the painfull ſtudents, faint and wearied in this long and weariſome iourney, might recreate themſelues; I preſently, as ſoone as I awaked, went about it: and while I ſurueigh all the quarters of the huge globe of the Earth, behold the noble TEMPE, famous for their ſacred groues, by the leading of <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> that renowmed Geographer, do offer themſelues to my view and conſideration: thoſe therefore ſhaddowed out in their true and liuely colours with the beſt art of painters pencill: and rudely deſcribed by our more vnskilfull penne we haue annexed to the end of theſe our labours. They are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in AEMMONIA, as <hi>Ouid</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> do teſtifie: or THESSALIA, which is all one in the iudgement of <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Liuy.</hi> But in regard that the riuer <hi>Peneus (Pezin,</hi> or <hi>Salampria)</hi> doth part <hi>Theſſaly</hi> from <hi>Macedony,</hi> they ſeeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſituate in the confines of both theſe countries, than to be conteined wholly within the bound of one. <hi>Strabo Pliny, Herodotus, Liuy</hi> and <hi>Theon,</hi> the petifogger, by the iudgement of <hi>Theopompus,</hi> do place theſe <hi>Tempe,</hi> or this large and pleaſant plaine (through the middeſt of which the goodly cleare riuer <hi>Peneus</hi> doth runne) between the two ſtately mountaines <hi>Oſſa, (Olira,</hi> or <hi>Coſſouo)</hi> and <hi>Olympus,</hi> now called <hi>Lacha. Solinus</hi> alſo is of the ſame opinion, as appeareth by theſe his wordes: <hi>Peneus</hi> the riuer, which running between the mountaines <hi>Oſſa</hi> and <hi>Olympus,</hi> with the goodly hils riſing and falling gently by degrees, and woody vales, doth make the pleaſant <hi>Tempe</hi> in <hi>Theſſalia; Tempe, quae ſyluae cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt ſuper impendentes,</hi> The <hi>Tempe</hi> which the ouer-hanging groues do round incloſe, as <hi>Catullus</hi> the poet in his <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nautickes,</hi> hath left recorded. It is, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, about three lands breadths ouer, <hi>(ſeſqui iugerum, AElianus</hi> calleth it <hi>Plethrum.)</hi> The length (which they do define to be from the mouth of the riuer <hi>Gannum,</hi> euen vnto the bay, now vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called <hi>Golfo di Salonichi,</hi> then <hi>Sinus Thermaeus</hi>) is as <hi>Liuy</hi> teſtifieth fiue miles, or as <hi>AElianus</hi> ſaith, which is all one, forty furlongs. Theſe mountaines, <hi>Liuy</hi> writeth are ſo high, ſteepe, and craggy on all ſides, that a man may ſcarce looke downe from off the toppe of them, without a dazling of the eies, and giddineſſe of the braine. The noiſe alſo and depth of the riuer <hi>Peneus,</hi> which runneth through the middeſt of the valley, is very terrible. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith that the ſtately toppes of theſe mountaines, on euery ſide do riſe by little and little vp higher into the aire, than a man may well diſcern. Within theſe hils the goodly riuer <hi>Peneus</hi> doth runne; which for his cryſtall waters, rowling ouer the ſmooth pebbles; the goodly meddowes and graſſe alwaies freſh and green vpon the bankes: the ouerhanging groues and trees continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſounding with the melodious harmony of ſweet ſinging birds, is ſo pleaſant and delightſome as any in the world beſide. But becauſe all theſe authours haue ſpoken of it, as it were by the way, and not of ſet purpoſe: I thinke it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to ſet downe in this place, the deſcription of it, done by <hi>AElianus</hi> as you may read in the firſt chapter of his third booke <hi>De varia hiſtoria,</hi> where it is moſt curiouſly and abſolutely ſet out in his true and liuelie colours. Theſe therefore are his wordes.</p>
            <p>There is a place between <hi>Olympus</hi> and <hi>Oſſa,</hi> the two loftieſt mountaines of all <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> diſioined one from another, by the diuine prouidence of eternall God, by a faire plaine or leuell running between them: the length of this plaine or valley is fortie furlongs: It is from one ſide to the other in ſome places, two or three lands breadths ouer, in ſome places it is ſomewhat broader. Through the middeſt of this valley runneth the riuer <hi>Peneus:</hi> into which alſo other riuers fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and mingling their waters with his, do much encreaſe the ſtreame of <hi>Peneus.</hi> This place is moſt pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome, by reaſon of his great varietie of all ſorts of alluring and inticeing pleaſures, neuer made by any art or induſtry of man, but by nature it ſelfe, ſhewing all her skill in the beautifying of this valleie, at ſuch time as it was firſt made. There is in this place great ſtore of iuie alwaie green and flouriſhing, alwaie budding and putting forth his pleaſant ſlowres, euer clinging and winding in maner like the goodlie vine, about the talleſt trees, and clambring vp by little and little vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it come euen to the verie toppe. In the ſame places grow the aie-green yeugh-tree, which lifting vp it ſelfe aloft vpon the rockes, ſhaddoweth the caues, holes and cliffes, which beneath lie lurking in the vale. All other things whatſoeuer do flouriſh, bloſſome, and beare flowers are there to be ſeene: this is a moſt gallant and glorious ſhew for the eies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. In the plaine, when the ſunne is at his height in ſummer, you ſhall haue manie goodlie ſhaddowie groues and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of ſhelter, into which trauellers, deſirous for to refreſh their wearied limmes from the violence of the heat and their noiſome ſweat, do betake themſelues, as into the moſt pleaſant and delightſomeſt innes and harboroughs that are in the world. Moreouer of ouerflowing wels and pleaſant ſprings of moſt coole and freſh waters running heere and there in ſundrie places of this valleie, there are verie manie and diuers: which if we ſhall beleeue the report of our fathers, haue been verie wholeſome and ſoueraigne to ſundrie ſorts of diſeaſed perſons that haue waſhed themſelues in the ſame. Againe, diuers birds heere and there diſperſed in theſe groues and woods, do make the gueſts great mirth at their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, with their ſweet ſinging and pleaſant tunes: eſpecially thoſe which haue the lowdeſt and ſweeteſt voices, do ſo pleaſe and hold the eares of the heares, that thoſe which paſſe by this waie are ſo rauiſhed and delighted with this their muſicke, that they inſtantly forget all their trauels and buſineſſe. On ech banke of the riuer ſuch are the delights, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and recreations for the wearied trauellers, as before we haue mentioned. Yet the riuer <hi>Peneus,</hi> going on leaſurely, and ſmoothly like an oile, runneth quietly through the middeſt of the <hi>Tempe.</hi> About this riuer, by reaſon of the trees which grow vpon the bankes, and their farre-ſpreading boughs, is a moſt goodly ſhade: ſo that ſuch as row in boates, vp and downe vpon this ſtreame, for almoſt a whole day together, may ſaile in the pleaſant ſhade free from the violence and ſchorching heat of the ſunne. The people which dwell vpon this riuer, do oft times meet in companies, ſometimes in one place and ſometimes in another. Hauing done diuine ſeruice and ceremonies in due forme and maner, they ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet and make merrie. Therefore thoſe which do theſe ſeruices and performe theſe ceremonies being very many, it is no maruell though ſuch as come hither to walke for recreation, thoſe which trauell by this way or ſaile vp or downe this riuer vpon what occaſion ſoeuer, do continually ſmell a moſt ſweet and fragrant ſauour. In this maner this place was conſecrated with great honour &amp; religious ſeruices. Theſe things and many other hath <hi>Aelianus</hi> written of theſe <hi>Tempe.</hi>

            <p>Of theſe alſo <hi>Procopius</hi> (although he nameth them not by name) hath written in his fourth booke <hi>De Aedif. Iuſtiniani Imperatoris.</hi> There is a braue deſcription of theſe places in <hi>Catullus</hi> his Argonauticks. But I thinke it good here to ſet downe out of diuers writers certaine ſeuerall things of theſe <hi>Tempe,</hi> as they are here and there diſperſed in their works. <hi>Maximus Tyrius,</hi> in his xxxix. oration, hath left recorded, that diuine honour in olde time was done to the riuer <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> for his maruellous goodly beautie and farre-ſurpaſſing cleere waters. <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, that this riuer doeth admit into his channell the ſtreame of the brooke <hi>Eurotas,</hi> but ſo as it ſwimmeth aloft like oile; and hauing caried it ſo for a certaine ſpace, caſteth it off againe, as refuſing to quaint and intermeddle his ſiluer ſtreame with his filthy ſtincking troubled waters. The ſame authour ſayth, that here groweth great plentie of Laurell, Polypody, Dolichus (a kinde of beane) Wilde-time, and Water-lilly: but this hath a blacke flower, if we may beleeue <hi>Apuleius. Pauſanias</hi> in his <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cica,</hi> writeth that the temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> at <hi>Delphos</hi> was built of Laurell boughes which grew in this place. <hi>Mela</hi> and the Poets do ſpeake of <hi>Oſſa,</hi> the mountaine memorable for the fabulous ſtorie of the Giants: who alſo doe report, that the <hi>Lapithae</hi> a people of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> did ſometime dwell here. In the ſame mountaine I reade in <hi>Polyaenus</hi> his fourth booke, that <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Indica,</hi> (for ſo I do rather yeeld to haue it read, than <hi>India,</hi> as hitherto the interpretours haue ſet foorth, ſeeing that <hi>Indica</hi> is a countrey hard by <hi>Pontus,</hi> as <hi>Stephanus</hi> directly auerreth) by hewing downe the craggie cliffes of this mountaine, did make certaine ſmall ſtaires, which ſequent ages called <hi>Alexanders ladder.</hi> Nere theſe <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi> there is a water deſcribed by <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> which is ſo ilfauoured and filthy, that it will make any man affrayd to looke into it; and which, they ſay, will eat and conſume both braſſe and yron. <hi>Vitruuius</hi> alſo in the third chapter of his eighth booke ſaith, That in <hi>Teſſaly</hi> there is a well or ſpring of running water, whereof no cattell will drinke, nor any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of beaſt will once come neere; hard by this fountain is a tree which beareth a purple flower. Thus far <hi>Vitruuius.</hi> Of the mount <hi>Olympus</hi> (which <hi>Homer,</hi> in the ſecond booke of his <hi>Odyſſes,</hi> calleth <hi>The ſeat of the Gods) Solinus</hi> out of the ſixt booke of <hi>Varro, De lingua Latina,</hi> citeth, That it riſeth vp ſo exceeding high into the aire, that the people neere adioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do call his lofty top, <hi>Heauen. Lucane</hi> ſaith that <hi>it is higher than the clouds.</hi> For <hi>it is tenne furlongs high,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Aemilius,</hi> by the authority of <hi>Xenagoras,</hi> who meaſured it, hath left recorded. <hi>No bird nor fowle doth flie higher than the toppe of this hill,</hi> as <hi>Apuleius</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>De Deo Socratis,</hi> doth affirme. In the very toppe of it there is an <hi>Altar built and conſecrated to Iupiter,</hi> where if any of the entrals of beaſts ſacrificed be left, they are neither blowen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by the bluſtring blaſts of the rougheſt windes, nor diſſolued by the dampiſh aire or waſhing ſtormie raines: but the next yeere after, that time twelue-moneth, looke how they were left, ſo they ſhall finde them: and at all times and ſeaſons of the yeere, whatſoeuer is there once conſecrated and offered to that God, is preſerued from all putrefaction and corruption of the aire: Letters alſo written and drawen in the aſhes doe ſo remaine vntill the next ſolemnity of the like rites and ceremonies the yeere following. Thus farre <hi>Solinus Polyhiſtor. Et nubibus intactum Macedo miratur O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympum:</hi> The Macedonian braue admir'th <hi>Olympus</hi> top to ſee So high and ſtately, far aboue the higheſt clouds to be: as <hi>Claudian</hi> the poet hath ſpoken of it in his poeme of the warres of the Goths. Of this mountaine, <hi>Varro,</hi> in his ſixth booke <hi>De lingua Latina,</hi> noteth that the Muſes were named <hi>Olympiades.</hi> And thus far generally of theſe <hi>Tempe,</hi> which from the beginning had not this forme and goodly countenance as all ancient writers doe conſtantly with one conſent affirme: but the riuer <hi>Peneus,</hi> being incloſed with mountaines, and entertaining many riuers into it, did all ouerflow the valley, making it to ſtand full of water like a fenne or pond: and afterward when the mountaines <hi>Olympus</hi> and <hi>Oſſa,</hi> which ſometime did touch one another, were diſioyned and rent aſunder (which happened by reaſon of an earthquake, as <hi>Strabo, Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> haue written: others, as <hi>Herodotus, Claudian,</hi> and <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> do aſcribe it to <hi>Neptune:</hi> others, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Lucane,</hi> to <hi>Hercules</hi>) and ſo by that meanes <hi>Peneus</hi> found an iſſue and way to vnload it ſelfe into the maine ocean; whereby it came to paſſe that the valley was emptied and cleane dried vp. By <hi>Stephanus</hi> in his booke of Cities, I finde that this tract and plot of ground was firſt called LYTAE, before it was disburdened of thoſe waters. <hi>Eurypides</hi> in his tragedy intituled <hi>Troades,</hi> calleth it <hi>Semnan choran,</hi> the ſacred and honourable countrey. Amongſt the poets there is euery where much ſpeech of this moſt goodly coaſt: to wit, in <hi>Virgill, Ouid, Horace, Catullus, Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, Statius, Lucan, Flaccus</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> where you may obſerue theſe epithites attributed and ſpoken of it; ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it <hi>Tempe Theſſala, Peneia, Heliconia, Phthiotica;</hi> others, <hi>Tempe Frigida, Tenebroſa, Nemoroſa, Opaca, Gratiſsima, Lucentia, Oloria,</hi> and <hi>Teumeſsia.</hi> The paradiſe of <hi>Theſſaly, Peneus, Helicon, Phthiotis:</hi> the colde, ſhadowy, woody, coole, kinde, ſwanny and Teumeſſiam paradiſe; although this latter, with the ſingular learned man <hi>Hermolaus Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> I doe thinke not to belong properly to this place, but rather vnto another moſt delightfull place in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> where we learne out of <hi>Pauſanias, Strabo, Stephanus</hi> and <hi>Heſychius,</hi> that the mountaine <hi>Teumeſſus</hi> is ſeated. For <hi>Lutatius</hi> the Grammarian I hold to be deceiued, who calleth the place The city <hi>Trumeſsia.</hi> Neither is this altogether an vnaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thing or vnuſuall amongſt writers, eſpecially poets, to vſe this word <hi>Tempe,</hi> and to ſpeake it figuratiuely of other places, famous for their many delightfull pleaſures; as you may ſee by <hi>Heloria Tempe,</hi> a place in <hi>Sicilia;</hi> and another in <hi>Tiburtina villa Latij,</hi> a place in <hi>Villa Hadriani;</hi> if you will giue credit to <hi>Spartianus</hi> in the life of the Emperour <hi>Hadrian:</hi> againe there was a College in <hi>Athens</hi> knowen by this name. So <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Priſcianus</hi> do name <hi>Daphne,</hi> the ſuburbs of <hi>Antioch, Tempe. Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Flaminius</hi> deſcribeth a place neere the riuer <hi>Apſus (Spirnaſſe</hi> or <hi>Vreo</hi> in <hi>Macedonia)</hi> for pleaſantneſſe much reſembling the <hi>Tempe.</hi> Of theſe and ſuch like places I cannot but I muſt needs adde theſe words of the Emperour <hi>Iulian</hi> vnto <hi>Libanius</hi> the ſophiſter, and ſo to end my ſpeech of this moſt goodly valley: Then, ſaith he, <hi>Batnae,</hi> a city of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> did entertaine me: a place ſuch, as, only <hi>Daphne,</hi> the ſuburbs of <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in all my life I neuer ſaw the like: <hi>Daphne</hi> which now is compared to <hi>Batnae,</hi> when as before excepting the temple and image, I would not doubt not only to compare it, but alſo farre to preferre it, before <hi>Oſſa, Pelion, Olympus,</hi> and the Theſſalian vallies &amp;c. (he meaneth <hi>Tempe</hi>). Theſe <hi>Batnae</hi> are ſituate (if any man be deſirous to know) in <hi>Oſroëna,</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> as <hi>Zozimus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> doe thinke; or in <hi>Anthemuſia,</hi> as <hi>Ammianus</hi> affirmeth; in the way betweene <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Carrae.</hi> Thus farre of theſe <hi>Tempe.</hi> But becauſe I ſee that <hi>Daphne,</hi> the ſuburbs of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> is of ſome writers conteined vnder this name, and that it is as pleaſant a place as the <hi>Tempe,</hi> I will addreſſe my ſelfe to deſcribe and tricke this out alſo; but in the next page following, not in this.</p>

This pleaſant place who can but loue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much of the name, ſituation, &amp; nature of this place: now there do yet remaine ſome things ſomewhat pertinent to this matter, which I thought good to adioyne to thoſe former. <hi>Saint Hierome, Euſebius</hi> in his Chronicle, and <hi>Sextus Rufus</hi> do write, that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, returning from <hi>Perſia,</hi> conſecrated this groue, and thereto adioyned a goodly large forreſt. <hi>Ammianus</hi> attributeth the building of the temple to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes: Sozomen,</hi> and <hi>Calliſtus,</hi> to <hi>Seleucus: Theodoret</hi> ſaith, that the image or ſtatue, within was of wood, but on the outſide gilt all ouer: this alſo <hi>Simon Metaphraſtes,</hi> in the place before cited, doth iuſtifie to be true: where he maketh a large deſcription of the ſame: <hi>Cedrenus</hi> affirmeth, that this image was the workmanſhip of <hi>Bryxides,</hi> or, <hi>Bryaxides,</hi> as I had rather reade with <hi>Vitruuius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Columella;</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> who writeth that he was one of the foure that carued the <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> that is, the tombe of <hi>Mauſolus</hi> king of <hi>Caria,</hi> made by his wife <hi>Artemiſia.</hi> It was inhibited by proclamation, That no Cypreſſe tree ſhould be taken from hence, or cut downe, and that whoſoeuer ſhould fell any of them, was to be grieuouſly puniſhed by an act made by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour. Theſe Cypreſſe trees were preſerued here, as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> writeth, in memory of <hi>Cypariſſus,</hi> a yong man of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this tree. <hi>Suidas</hi> recordeth, that this place was the natiue ſoile of <hi>Theon</hi> the Philoſopher and Stoicke, who wrote a defence of <hi>Socrates.</hi> I doe alſo remember, that I haue read in ſome good authour, whoſe name I haue forgotten, that there was one of the <hi>Sibylla's</hi> borne here. <hi>Ammianus</hi> telleth of a monſter borne here, as he himſelfe both ſaw with his eies, and heard with his eares from the relation of others: namely, of a childe hauing two mouthes, two teeth, a beard, foure eies, and two very ſhort or little eares. In <hi>Strabo</hi> I finde recorded from the relation of <hi>Nicolaus Damaſcenus,</hi> that from <hi>Porus,</hi> a King of <hi>India,</hi> certaine Ambaſſadours came hither to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar. Procopius</hi> in the ſecond booke of his Perſian ſtories writeth, that <hi>Coſroes</hi> the king of <hi>Perſia</hi> did here ſacrifice to the Nymphes. With what pompe and traine <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> did once come to this place, what ſhewes and bankets he made here, as alſo one <hi>Grypus</hi> at another time, if any man be deſirous to ſee, let him reade <hi>Athenaeus</hi> his fifth and tenth books, and I doubt but he will greatly woonder. Of this <hi>Daphne,</hi> I would to God that worke of <hi>Protagorides,</hi> which he wrote of the Daphnenſian Playes, Feaſts, and Aſſemblies, whereof <hi>Athenaeus</hi> maketh mention in his fourth booke; together with that oration written by <hi>Libanius</hi> the Sophiſter, which <hi>Iulian</hi> in his epiſtles ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, and ſo highly commendeth, were extant. <hi>Agathias</hi> in the prooeme to his hiſtorie affirmeth that he wrote the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this <hi>Daphne</hi> in Hexameter verſe. I ſayd before out of <hi>Tacitus</hi> that <hi>Germanicus Caeſar</hi> kept his Court in this forreſt, in whom, at this day in the 11 booke of his Annals, we reade theſe words: His tombe was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where his corps was burnt: his court he held at <hi>Epidaphne,</hi> in which place he ended his dayes. Here for <hi>Epidaphne</hi> I reade <hi>Daphne,</hi> or, at <hi>Daphne:</hi> For of <hi>Epidaphne,</hi> for the name of a place, I finde no mention in any hiſtory, beſide in <hi>Pliny,</hi> in his one and twentieth chapter of his fifth booke, where thou haſt theſe words: <hi>Antiochia libera, Epidaphnes cognominata:</hi> as if this were a ſynonyme or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent to <hi>Antiochia;</hi> yet being indeed as corrupt and falſly written as that other, and ought to be thus amended, <hi>Antiochia libera apud Daphnen, Antioch</hi> by <hi>Daphne</hi> is free.

            <head>Of the firſt FOVNDATION and ORDER of the GERMANE EMPIRE in the Weſt. THE FIRST TABLE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER that IVLIVS CAESAR had by continuall warres appeaſed almoſt all thoſe broiles and ſeditious quarels which for certaine yeeares paſſed had much troubled the Romane ſtate, and had ſent Pompey and thoſe other vnfortunate enuiers of his valour and proſperous ſucceſſe in martiall affaires, either dead vnto the Diuell, or aliue by baniſhment had remooued them farre off into forren countries, as a valiant Conquerour of all entereth triumphantly into ROME: where challenging and aſſuming vnto himſelfe a ſoueraigne authority and honour aboue all (himſelfe indeed as a Monarch at his pleaſure commanding all) was the firſt that began the FOVRTH MONARCHY, which of the place where it firſt ſeated it ſelfe, was ſirnamed, <hi>The Romane Monarchy.</hi> In this dignity, which was the greateſt that could be giuen to any mortall man, carrying himſelfe moſt tyrannouſly and proudly (for he commanded that his ſtatue or image ſhould be ſet vp amongſt the odious and wicked kings, and that his chaire of Eſtate ſhoud be made of beaten gold, and withall requeſted the Citizens to giue vnto him diuine honour; and to worſhip him as a god) certaine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen or Senators, loathing that his lordly gouernment in the Senat houſe wounded him in three &amp; twenty ſeuerall places, whereof he died, in the yeare 709. after the building of the city of Rome. Notwithſtanding he being thus made away, the chiefe authority and Empire ceaſſed not to reſide amongſt the Romanes, for AVGVSTVS, the ſole adopted heire of Caeſar, preſently ſteppeth into the Imperiall ſeat, and by force of armes layeth hold vpon the ſoueraigne dignity and whatſoeuer elſe his predeceſſour had by hooke or crooke poſſeſſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed. Vnder his gouernment all things being ſtill and huſhed, there being now not ſo much as the leaſt noice of tumultuous warres ſtirring in the world, all men generally admiring this bleſſed and happy peace, do withall in like maner of all policies, highly extoll the monarchy, as authour and preſeruer of the ſame. Vnder the name of this title, the Romanes alone for many ages together moſt honourable and fearefull to others, were victours and conquerours whereſoeuer they became; vntill at length certaine idle and cruell minded men being promoted vnto that dignity, did chooſe rather tyrannouſlie to ſhew their force and power at home againſt their kinsfolke, friends, ſubiects, and beſt men of all ſorts, then abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the publicke enemy and diſturber of the ſtate. Theſe men by all maner of vnlawfull meanes ſucceeding one another, at laſt the Empire and managing of the common-wealth was onely in the hands of Tyrants and Vſurpers: neither was there any man now that euer would once trouble himſelfe to defend the ſame from the furious aſſault of the raging enemy: and no maruell. For euen the Empire it ſelfe, and whatſoeuer did of right belong vnto the ſame, was by the ſouldiers bought and ſold for money, or giuen for fauour and affection. While all things ſtood thus in the Roman Empire, ODOACER, king of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> with a mighty army inuadeth the ſame, and in all places whereſoeuer he became, ouerthroweth and beateth downe the Romane forces and garriſons: for at this time in the idle and diſſolute ſouldiers there remained neither ſtrength nor true fortitude. AVGVSTVLVS the Emperour, hearing of theſe newes, being ſmitten into a great feare, flieth, and that he might the better eſcape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, in the flight throweth off his imperiall robes and ornaments. In the meane time Odoacer ſpeedeth himſelfe toward Rome, beſiegeth it, taketh it, and within a few daies after he was wholly and quietly poſſeſſed of it, changeth the name of it, and after his owne name cauſed it by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be called ODOACRIA: but together with the ancient name this city leaueth the former beauty and luſture, there is nothing now heere to be ſeene but miſerable deſtruction and ruine. This proſperous ſucceſſe and eaſie inuaſion of the city of Rome by Odoacer, within foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yeares after, giueth occaſion to THEODORICVS, king of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> who was then in Thrace, to attempt the ſame. Therefore muſtering his men, with many thouſands of Goths, he entreth Italy, driueth Odoacer out of Rome, and again the ſecond time neere to Verona ſetteth vpon him, and putting him &amp; his forces to flight, followeth him to Rauenna, where he beſiegeth him continually for the ſpace of three yeares together, but at length being forced to yeeld the city he was by him taken and put to death. Neither did this ſatisfie frowning Fortune that Rome was thus once or twiſe taken, ſacked and conſumed with fire, except the LONGOBARDI, <hi>Lombardes,</hi> a ſtrange and cruell people do alſo inuade Italy, to deface and ouerthrow all things whatſoeuer the former enemies had left vntouched and ſtanding. All things are now deformed and caſt downe whatſoeuer in former times were moſt beautifull and glorious, the Romane citizen is compelled to forſake that ancient and famous title ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioied by them, and by meanes of this ſo irrecouerable a dammage the name of an Emperour was for euer baniſhed out of Italy. The caſe thus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Romanes, deſtitute of all helpe at home, and in vaine expecting the ſame from the Greeks, (who for their Empire contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues only with Conſtantinople) the Pope of Rome for defence of the Church was forced in this great diſtreſſe to entreat aid of Charles, king of the Frankes, who afterward was ſirnamed CHARLES THE GREAT. This good king pricked on forward with a godly zeale for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſtian religion, paſſing with a great army ouer the Alpes, putteth the Lombards to flight, taketh their king Deſiderius with his wife and children, vtterly ouerthroweth their kingdome and cleane extinguiſheth that impious race. The Pope obſeruing his inuincible courage, and his ſiugular loue that he bare to the Church and religion, with the generall conſent and admirable applauſe of all men, in the yeare after Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation 801. crowneth him with the Imperiall diademe, and giueth him the title of AVGVSTVS and GREAT EMPEROVR of the Weſt. This king was the firſt that of the Dutch was called Emperour, and that tranſlated that dignity from the Greekes vnto the Germanes. He valiantly aſſailed the Hunnes, and at laſt with continuall wars ſo afflicted them that they were neuer after able to gather head againe. The Normanes, Frei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Danes, Angles, Saxons, and others moleſting the Empire, he wonderfully vexed and weakened. Hauing on all ſides greatly enlarged his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and for the ſpace of fowreteene yeares ſwaied the ſcepter quietly at home, void of tumults and noiſe of warre, he committed the gouernment of the ſame to his ſonne Lewis, ſirnamed the Religious, and ended his life at Aquiſgran. After the reigne of this Charles, the digni y and title of the Empire remained not amongſt the Germanes without continuall warres and bloudſhed, diuers kings coueting to annex the ſame to their crowne and nation, by dint of ſword aſſaied by all meanes to bring their purpoſe to paſſe. To ſeat it amongſt the French, Charles the Bald, ſpareth no coſt, ventureth life and limme, and ſetteth all the world together by the eares: yet the Germanes valiantly fighting for the Imperiall ti le and dignity; do after many ſore conflicts quite and cleane driue him out of Germany. Lewis the Fourth moſt furiouſly ſetteth vpon Berengarius an vſurper lately proclaimed Emperour in Italy, ouercommeth him in the field, and forceth him to betake him to his heeles. The Italians oft deſired that this dignity once loſt might againe be reſtored to them. (and no maruell: ſeeing that euery nation doth account it a moſt honourable thing to haue the name of an Empire reſident amongſt them.) Yet maugre all externall ſpite this dignity for many ages together remained in the hands of the Germanes, the Princes of this country manfully defending and preſeruing it by force of armes from all iniuries and forren inuaſions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer. Vntill at length the forenamed Princes, foreſeeing what was beſt for the ſtate and good of the Empire, did chuſe for their Emperor, Otto the Fourth, the naturall ſonne of Otto the Third, a yong man brought vp at Rome, &amp; had been ſomtime in the cuſtody and tuition of Henry Duke of Bayern. This Emperor perceiuing that it would not be an eaſie thing to appeaſe and end the warres and controuerſies that did ariſe about the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and choice of the Emperor, except by ſome other meanes &amp; order this choice were made, did therefore inuent a certaine order and maner of election, whereby heereafter all cauſe of diſſention and tumult, was wholly taken from all men, and by which for euer it might quietly be retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt the Germanes. This order is heere expreſſed in this Mappe, and is in effect thus much: In the firſt ranke are the Seuen PRINCE ELECTOVRS and Officers of the ſacred Romane Empire, inſtituted by Otto the Third: whereof the Three vpon the right hand, are Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perſons or Churchmen, to wit, the ARCHBISHOP OF TRIER, (a city ſituate vpon the riuer Moſelle) chiefe Chancellour for the Empire in the kingdome of France: The ARCHBISHOP OF COLEN, vpon the Rhein, Chiefe Chancellour in Italy; and the ARCHBISHOP OF MENTZ, Chiefe Chancellour in Germany: The other Foure vpon the left hand, are Secular or Lay men: the Firſt, is the KING OF BOHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIA, the Cup-bearer: the Second is the COVNTY PALATINE of Rhein, the Sewer: the Third is the DVKE OF SAXONY, the Sword-bearer: the Fourth is the MARQVESSE OF BRANDENBVRG, the Lord Great Chamberlaine to the Emperour. In the Second ranke doe follow, firſt the Foure Dukes of the Empire, to wit, the DVKE OF SVVITZERLAND, the DVKE OF BRVNSVVICKE, the DVKE OF BAYERN, and the DVKE OF LOREIN. Then vpon the left hand, the Foure MARQVESSES, <hi>videlicet,</hi> the MARQVISSE OF MEIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEN, the MARQVESSE OF MORAVV, the MARQVESSE OF BADEN, and the MARQVESSE OF BRANDENBVRG. In the Third and laſt ranke do follow the Eight EARLES of the Empire: whereof the LANDTGRAVE OF DVRINGEN, the LANDGRAVE OF HESSEN, the Earles of LVCHTENBVRG, and of ALSATIA, are Earles Prouinciall: the other Foure, MEIDENBVRG, NVRVBERG, RENECK, and STOMEBVRG, are Earles Marſhall or of the field.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>TTO the Fourth, or, as ſome haue written, OTTO the Third, of whom wee haue ſpoken in the former Mappe, vnderſtanding that Gregory the Fifth, Pope of Rome, whom he had not long ſince promoted to that dignity, was driuen out of his Sea, and Creſcentius a Conſul or Alderman of Rome by the Romanes made Emperour, paſſeth the Alpes with a great power, furiouſly aſſaulteth Italy, forceth the Romanes, and any other cities that had ſtood out againſt him for the aduerſe part, to ſet open their gates and to yeeld themſelues to his mercy. Creſcentius, when he heard that the enemy was receiued into the city, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly amazed, and therefore betaketh himſelfe with Pope Iohn, the vſurper which he had promoted to that dignity, vnto Adrians caſtle, which not long before he had fortified and repaired, for their laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and ſuccour. But being not able to ſuſtaine the batterie and violent aſſaults which dayly the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſouldiers made againſt him, at length yeeldeth the caſtle and himſelfe to Otto: who preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Creſcentius the authour of this commotion to haue his eies put out, his noſe cut off, and to be caried on horſebacke round about the towne with his face to the horſetaile: This being done his iudgement was to haue his hands and feet to be cut off, and at the townes end to be hanged vpon a paire of gallowes, where, before he was altogether dead, the ſouldiers do pitifully wound and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle him from top to toe. Moreouer Pope Iohn, the vſurper, being diſplaced, Gregory vpheld and maintained by Otto, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours authority, climbeth vp againe into the Papall throne, from which before he had moſt iniuriouſly, by Creſcentius, beene expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Then Gregory to requite the kindneſſe of the Emperour and his Germanes, and withall that he might ſufficiently reuenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of the Romanes for the intolerable wrongs that they had done vnto him, conſulteth with the Emperour about a new law and forme of election of the Emperour, to be made by the Princes of Germany, that this choice might only and for euer remaine in their power, and againe that they ſhould alwaies chooſe one of their corporation or body, as it were, vnto that dignity, which cuſtome remaineth euen to theſe our daies duely kept and obſerued. By vertue of this their choice, he is by and by vpon that their election to be called only, CAESAR and KING OF THE ROMANES, but hauing receiued the Imperiall diademe from the hands of the Pope, he was euer after to beare the title of IMPERATOR AVGVSTVS. But before theſe ordinances were publiſhed, Otto calling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Princes and States of Germany, ſhewed them how confuſedly and diſorderly the choice and election of the Emperor had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beene made, and how many there haue beene, which haue aſſaied by all meanes poſſible to preferre their friends and kinsfolke vnto that dignity, which thing cannot but in continuance of time, breed great diſſention and danger to the Chriſtian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and that it were therefore good that ſome of the Princes of Germanie were choſen, which might haue the whole power and authority of this election; and withall admoniſheth them, that the fewer there were of thoſe Electours, ſo much leſſe the contention would be that ſhould ariſe about the choice. Moreouer he endeuoured to perſwade them that theſe Electours might bee appointed and taken out of the Peeres and Officers of the Empire, for that they of all other beſt knew what was good for the body and ſtate of that kingdome and empire. All men generally liking of that courſe and counſell by him propoſed, the Emperour and the Pope nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated vnto them firſt, <hi>Three eccleſiaſticall Princes,</hi> biſhops of Germany, which they wiſhed might be the Lord Chiefe Chancellours of the Empire, to wit, <hi>The biſhop of Mentz,</hi> for all matters in Germany; <hi>The biſhop of Colen,</hi> for Italy; <hi>The biſhop of Trier,</hi> for France; To theſe they adioined <hi>Foure Secular Princes,</hi> which ſhould in all things aid the Emperour, attend vpon his perſon, and that ſhould acknowledge him for their Lord and Monarch of the World: viz. <hi>The Duke of Saxony,</hi> Sword bearer to his Maieſty, ſignifying that hee is the fountaine of Iuſtice: <hi>The Marqueſſe of Brandenburgh,</hi> Lord Great Chamberlaine: <hi>The County Palatine of Rhein,</hi> Sewer: and <hi>The K ng of Bohemia,</hi> Cup-bearer: theſe were to attend vpon the Emperour and to gard his perſon. By theſe the King of the Romans was choſen, the Caeſar (or he that was next to be Emperour) was appointed: in their hands the whole right, intereſt and authority of chooſing that king reſided, leſt any man heereafter, as heeretofore had beene vſuall, ſhould challenge this dignity vnto himſelfe as due by inheritance from his anceſtours. Charles the Fourth many yeares after this compriſed this inſtrument or act into a bullion or tablet of gold, which to this day is extant, wherein hee explaned euery particular more expreſly and ſignificantly. It is reported that this ordinance was decreed vpon, and made in the yeare of Grace 1001 and did much diſcontent the Frenchmen, who tooke it hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly as a great indignity offered vnto them. Yet beſide theſe there were then, and afterward in ſuccedent ages were, made many and ſundry other ordinances and decrees in the Romane Empire, and diuers other Offices appointed and erected for the ſtate and greater maieſty of the Empire. For beſide theſe ſeuen <hi>Electours,</hi> there were appointed, Foure <hi>Dukes,</hi> Foure <hi>Marqueſſes,</hi> Foure <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues,</hi> Foure <hi>Burggraues,</hi> Foure <hi>Earles,</hi> Foure <hi>Barons,</hi> Foure <hi>Knights</hi> of the field, Foure <hi>Cities,</hi> Foure <hi>Villages,</hi> and Foure <hi>Yeomen</hi> or Ruſticks, all which offices we haue expreſſed in their true characters in theſe two mappes appointed for that purpoſe only. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding other Emperours following, not content with theſe conſtitutions and ordinances, haue daiely made new Dukes and Earles, yea and many that were but Earles before they haue aduanced to the title and honour of Dukes. To theſe forenamed dignities, that they might, as much as was poſſible, ſtrengthen the ſtate of the Empire, they haue adioined certaine other new officers, to wit theſe which follow: Foure HIGH MARSHALS, as <hi>Bappenheim, Gulich, Meiſſen,</hi> and <hi>Vniſtingen:</hi> Foure LORDS OF THE SOILE, <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Scala, Padua,</hi> and <hi>Mirandula:</hi> Foure BORROVGHS of the Empire, <hi>Aldenburgh, Meidenburgh, Rotenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Mecklenburgh:</hi> Foure KNIGHTS or Seruants, <hi>Waldeck, Hirten</hi> of Fulchen, <hi>Arnſperg,</hi> and <hi>Rabnaw:</hi> Foure SOVLDIERS, <hi>Andlaw, Meldingen, Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decke,</hi> and <hi>Fornberg:</hi> Foure LORD ABBOTS, <hi>Fulden, Campidon, Wiſſenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Murbach:</hi> Foure HVNTSMEN, <hi>Hurn, Vrach, Scomburgh,</hi> and <hi>Metſch</hi> neere to Curia: Foure VILLAGES, <hi>Ingelheim, Altdorff, Lichtenaw,</hi> and <hi>Deckendorff:</hi> Foure MOVNTAINS of the Empire, <hi>Nunſterberg, Friedberg, Heydelberg,</hi> and <hi>Nurnberg:</hi> Foure OFFICES hereditary to the Dukedome of Switzerland, <hi>The Sewer of Waldprugh, The Cupbearer of Radach, The Marſhall of Merkdorff, and The Chamberlaine of Kemnat.</hi> Yer many of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities are altered and changed into others, or wholly aboliſhed and extinct by the death of thoſe which held them, as it is at large to be ſeene in Munſters Coſmography. If any man be moreouer deſirous to know the names of the Imperiall cities, let him repaire to the ſame authour, he ſhalbe ſatisfied to his full content. Item Charles the Fourth, Emperour of Germany did make beſides theſe many other conſtitutions. When the Emperour ſitteth in his Maieſty and chaire of Eſtate then the Archbiſhop of Trier ſitteth ouer againſt him, the Archbiſhop of Mentz vpon his right hand, and the Archbiſhop of Colen on his left: The King of Bohemia taketh his ſeat vpon the right hand of the Archbiſhop, and by him the County palatine of Rhein placeth himſelfe, the Duke of Saxony ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon the left hand of the Archbiſhop, and by him the Marqueſſe of Brandenburgh. But of theſe offices, diuers authours do write diuerſly; wherefore it being not our purpoſe to make a large diſcourſe of this matter, we ſend the Reader, for further ſatisfaction heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to the forenamed Sebaſtian Munſter and other Hiſtoriographers of Germany, who haue handled this argument more amply.</p>

            <p>The MONASTERIE, or place of reſidence for the monkes and friars, hath a very goodly <hi>Steeple</hi> wherein doe hang a fine ring of <hi>Bels,</hi> with a <hi>Clocke</hi> and <hi>Diall,</hi> with an Index ſhewing the Naturall and Planetary howres. The Wardrope, Hall or Roome where the monkes and friars do vſe to dine and ſuppe, with the ſpittle, are moſt goodlily built with Sollers, Galleries and Walkes. Moreouer heere is a faire Cloiſter or Square, where publike praiers are daily read: In the middeſt of this ſquare is a very fine garden moſt artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially diuided into beds and curious knots. In the middeſt of it is a goodly piece of worke, built eight ſquare in maner of a temple, with fountaines of the beſt iaſper. To this Cloiſter is adioining the Chapter-houſe, with another roome very like vnto it. The Seats of the monkes are round about by the ſides: but the Seat of the Priour doth farre excell the reſt, a famous piece of worke made of marble, gloriouſly ſet out with pictures, and curiouſly arched ouer the head. The LIBRARY which is vpon the toppe of the Abbey, is 185. foot long, and 32. foot broad. It hath three ſundrie roomes; In the firſt are all the Liberall Sciences protraitured. At the feet of euery picture, are the Bookes of that facultie very orderly and finely placed, all of them gilt, and bound alike. Heere alſo is an huge Parchment booke, wherein all manner of liuing creatures that are in all the whole world, elſewhere to be ſeene, are moſt curiouſlie drawen and expreſſed in their true and liuely colours. In the Second are onely manuſcript Latine, Greeke and Hebrew bookes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity. In the beginning of euery booke is ſet the picture and counterfet of the authour of the ſame. In like maner the third roome is furniſhed only with manuſcript copies of ſundrie writers, and different argument in diuers languages, to wit, Hiſtoriographers, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, Mathematicians &amp;c. Theſe alſo haue, where they might poſſibly be gotten, the liuely portraitures and counterfets of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours ſet before them. This Library was much augmented by the addition of the Library of Didacus Hurtadus Mendoza, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſometime beene Ambaſſadour for Charles the fifth, Emperour of Rome, vnto the Venetians, receiued from the High country of Greece a ſhip full of manuſcript Greeke copies: ſo that excepting the Vaticane in Rome, which is the Popes Library, there is not, as moſt men thinke, a more ſtately and better furniſhed library then this in all Europe.</p>
            <p>I come now to the VNIVERSITY, and the KINGS PALLACE, both which are vpon the North ſide. In the VNIVERSITY there are three ſeuerall Schooles or Hals, where the three moſt famous and worthy artes <hi>Diuinity, Law</hi> and <hi>Phyſicke</hi> are read by their ſeuerall and proper Lecturers, beſide the other liberall Sciences which together with them are there taught and expounded vnto the yonger ſort of ſtudents. To this is adioined a Free Schoole for Grammar ſcholars, with ſundry other court yards, and hals or dining roomes.</p>
            <p>The PALACE is ſo ſituate, that from thence you may eaſily goe vnto the Church, the Colledge and monaſtery. It were a long diſcourſe particularly to deſcribe the ſeuerall lodgings of the King, the Ambaſſadours, Comptroulers, Chamberlaines, Noblemens, Penſioners, Yeomen of the guard and other Officers belonging to the Court. The Kings Gallery openeth toward the North ſide of the Church, vpon whoſe wall is painted the battell at Higueruela, in which King Iohn the Second ouercame the Moores of Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do. Which picture doth ſo liuelily expreſſe the whole ſtory and euery thing in it as it was done, as it is wonderfull. It ſheweth in what order, and how the maine battell was ſet, where the Horſemen, the Footmen, the Pikemen, the Targeters, the Archers, which then were in great requeſt, did ſtand, and how and where they ſeuerally charged the enemy. This piece of worke was made at the commandement of Philip the ſecond, king of Spaine, by an old patterne drawen in a piece of linnen cloth of an hundred and thirtie foot long, found in the old Towre of Segouia, which was firſt drawen at that time that this battell was fought. Moreouer vpon the Eaſt and South ſides of this building there is a moſt goodly and pleaſant Garden, which is an hundred foot broad, and is ſet out and beautified with diuerſe knots, rare hearbs, floures and fountaines. To this garden is adioined an Orchard planted and ſet with all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of trees. Within the precincts of this monaſtery there are more then forty fountaines. Such is the wonderfull number of Keies and Lockes about this houſe, which do amount vnto certaine thouſands, that there is a ſeueral and proper Officer for to looke to them onely, called, The maſter of the Keies. The forme of the monaſtery is foure-ſquare, and euery ſide is two hundred and twenty foure paſes long; only that ſide except that is next to the Pallace, which of purpoſe was made ſhorter then the other three, that the compaſſe or externall forme of the Abbey might repreſent the faſhion of the ſquare of a gridiron, for that S. Laurence, to whom this houſe was dedicated, was broiled to death vpon a gridiron. The Monkes which are in number three hundred, and as I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before, of the order of S. Hierome, do inhabite not paſt the third part of this whole building. Their yearly reuenews do amount to 35000. Duckets. The other part of the reuenewes they doe beſtow vpon the king and his family. That I may conclude, it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſo many Hals, Parlours, Chambers and other cloſets and roomes for neceſſary vſes in an houſe, that there is roome inough to entertaine and lodge fowre Kings and their Courts at once, to that it may worthily challenge the firſt place amongſt the greateſt miracles of the whole world.</p>

For (ſayth he) as France for thinneſſe and clearneſſe of the aire doth far excell England, ſo England for the ſame doth as far excell Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. For, this is certaine, the farther you go Eaſtward, looke by how much the aire is more ſubtile, pure and thinne, ſo much is it more fierce, ſharpe and piercing. On the contrary, the farther you go toward the South and Weſt parts of the world, by how much the aire is more thicke, cloudy and foggy, by ſo much it is more temperate, kinde and healthfull. For this countrey, lying in the midſt indifferently ſeated betweene frozen Iſland, and parched Spaine, and by that meanes getting a meane temperature betweene hot and cold, aſwell in reſpect of that temperature and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe of the aire, is a moſt goodly &amp; fertile iland. The champion fields do yeeld great ſtore of corne; the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines do feed many heards of cattell, the woods affoord many Deere and other kind of wild beaſts, the lakes and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers great variety and plenty of good fiſh. Yet the ſoile of this iland is better for Paſtorage than Arable-ground; for Graſſe than Corne. <hi>Multam fruges in Hibernia,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>plurimam in culmis, minorem in granis ſpem promittunt. Abundè ſatis &amp; campi veſtiuntur, &amp; horrea farciuntur, ſola verò granaria deſtituuntur.</hi> Here their corne, as long as it is in the graſſe (for <hi>Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> I read <hi>herba</hi>) is maruellous good, but much better it ſeemeth to be when it is ſhot vp and ſpindled, only it faileth when it commeth to the threſhing, then it is ſeldome found to be caſty. In the field it maketh a goodly ſhew, yea ordinarily it is as thicke as may ſtand vpon the ground, their barnes are crammed full and mowed vp to the top, only their garners are empty. Thus farre Giraldus: and becauſe we haue handled the generall deſcription of this iland in another place of this our worke, we will conclude this diſcourſe with a briefe deſcription of ſome few of their cities and principall townes, as we haue learned of that worthy gentleman Richard Stanihurſt, this countreyman bredde and borne. DVBLIN, ſituate vpon the riuer Liffe, in the countie of Dublin, the Metropolitan and chiefe citie not only of Leynſter, but alſo of all Ireland, for goodly faire buildings, multitude of people, ciuility, for ſweet aire and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, doth as farre excell all the other cities of this ile, as the lofty cypreſſe doth the loweſt ſhrubs. The <hi>Cathedrall church</hi> of S. Patricks was firſt founded by Iohn Cinim Archbiſhop of Dublin, in the yere of our Lord God 1197. That great and goodly ſtrong <hi>Caſtle</hi> was built by Henry Loundres Archbiſhop alſo of Dublin, about the yere of our Lord 1220. This city is very ancient, and was in Ptolemeys time (as learned men thinke) called <hi>Ciuitas Eblana,</hi> The city Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan. The next city in order and dignity is WATERFORD, a well gouerned towne, and one that hath been alwaies faithfull to England. It is very populous and ciuill, and (for that the hauen here is far better and more ſafe than that of Dublin) much reſorted vnto for trade and trafficke, by merchants of forren countreys. The ſtreets of it are very narrow and darke. Here no cutthroat-Iewiſh vſurer is permitted to vſe his diuelliſh occupation, that is, as Cato ſayd, to kill men, or to liue by the ſweat of other mens browes. The third is LIMMERICK, which in regard of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riuer Shenyn whereupon it is ſeated and ſtandeth, as alſo for the commodious ſituation of the ſame, might iuſtly challenge the firſt place. For this riuer is the greateſt and goodlieſt of all Ireland, whoſe depth and channell is ſuch, that notwithſtanding the city ſtandeth at the leaſt threeſcore miles from the maine ſea, yet ſhips of great burden doe come vp euen to the towne walles: beſides that it is woonderfully ſtored with great variety of freſh fiſh. King Iohn did like the ſituation of this city ſo well, that he cauſed there a goodly caſtle and faire bridge to be built. The laſt and leaſt is CORCK, ſituate vpon the riuer Leigh. This hauen is one of the beſt in all Ireland, and therefore the citizens are very wealthy and great merchants. Theſe three latter are all within the prouince of Mounſter. But if thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt a larger diſcourſe of theſe particulars, I wiſh thee to repaire to the foreſayd authour Richard Stanihurſt, he ſhall ſatisfie thee to the full.</p>

Item William of Newbury, a writer of good credit, and one that liued at the ſame time with this Geffrey of Munmouth, did accuſe him to his face of forgery, and challenged him for the ſame. For firſt, for the name of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons they neuer knew what it meant vntill the entrance of the Romans, and was then as harſh vnto theſe <hi>Cumbri,</hi> as the name of <hi>Welchman,</hi> is to them at this day; which it is certeine diuers of the vpland people do not acknowledge nor vnderſtand what it ſhould meane. Againe, Ludouicus Vines, Hadrianus Iunius, Buchanan, Polydore Virgil, Bodine and other great men, do all iointly confeſſe that there was neuer in the world any ſuch man as this Brutus. Moreouer, That preſently after the confuſion at Babell, in the infancy of the world, when the iles of the Gentiles were diuided into their lands, as the Scripture ſpeaketh, euery man after his tongue, after their families in their nations, that is, That ſuch men as by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of difference and diuerſity of language, did ſeparate themſelues from ſuch as they vnderſtood not, and therefore could not conuerſe withall, into their ſeuerall companies and hords, did beare the name and denomination of their father and prince of that family, it is very plaine and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: but that any nation was named or called after the name of the chiefe leader and conductour of a colony, I yet find not auouched by any good authour. It is moſt certaine and without all controuerſie true, That diuers countries haue beene called by ſundry names, by forreners and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, neuer knowen nor acknowledged of the nations themſelues. Do you thinke that the ancient inhabitants of Spaine did euer know what <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperia</hi> meant? None ſurely euer called that countrey by this name, but the Graecians only. <hi>Albion</hi> and <hi>Britannia</hi> doubtleſſe were names as barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vnto theſe our <hi>Cumbri,</hi> and neuer heard of before the entrance of the Romans. There is no Colony, although neuer ſo ſmall and few, but will reteine much of their owne countrey language, either wholly vncorrupt, or els manifeſtly to be diſtinguiſhed by the phraſe and proprietie of ſpeech. Thoſe few Flemmings who (their countrey being by the breaking in of the ſea ouerflowen and drowned) obteined of King Henrie the firſt, a part of Penbrooke ſhire in Wales which the Welchmen call Roſſe, lying betweene two riuers, not farre off from Milford hauen, are they not to this day diſtinguiſhed, from their neighbours round about them by their ſpeech and language? And becauſe their ſpeech doth much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Engliſh, is not their countrey commonly called, of thoſe which inhabit neere vnto them, <hi>Little England beyond Wales?</hi> The like you ſhall obſerue by the Britiſh colony, which aboue eleuen hundred yeeres ſince tooke poſſeſſion of that part of France, which of them euer ſince hath beene knowen by the name of Britaine: Of the colony of the Scots in Ireland, and of the Iriſh in Scotland. If any man will ſay that there is the like reſemblance betweene the Welch tongue and the Greeke or Latine, I will iuſtifie it that there is as great affinitie betweene the Welch and Arabicke, and againe that theſe are as like the one to other as an apple is to an oiſter. Moreouer, this entrance of Brute was an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, the giants (if there were euer any ſuch) being vtterly deſtroyed or quite chaced out of the land, and therefore there is no reaſon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary but they ſhould haue, for the ſpace of ſeuen hundred yeeres, kept their language from corruption, as well as they haue done ſince, being ſince the entrance of the Romans ſixteene hundred yeeres and more. The Latines or Greeks ſo prodigall alwayes in their owne commendation, would doubtleſſe not haue forgotten to record the ſetting forth of ſuch a famous colony. Could this affinity haue beene hid from Caeſar? would they not, thinke you, haue claimed kindred of the Romans? Conſtans and Conſtantius Emperours of Rome were the firſt, by the teſtimony of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Firmicus, that euer durſt venture thorow theſe ſeas. How then did this Brutus, ſo many hundred yeeres before, in ſuch ſmall barks, ſo ſlightly built, paſſe the ſame? Aeneas, they report, of his many ſhips loſt all but one before he could get home, in the Midland ſea, which is nothing ſo dangerous and troubleſome. Can it be thought credible that ſuch a warlike nation as theſe Troians, hauing ſo lately got footing and ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in ſo goodly a countrey as Italy, would ſo ſuddenly remoue ſo farre off, to a place vnknowen? The Romans hauing ſuch dangerous warres, and ſuch occaſion to vſe men and braue commanders, would neuer haue ſuffered them in ſuch troopes to paſſe out of their countrey. If it had tooke the name of Brutus, it ſhould doubtleſſe haue been called Brutania, not Britannia, as Caeſar nameth it, nor Bretania, Pretanice, or Pretanis, as the Greeks do write it. But liſt what Caeſar ſayth of this matter, <hi>Britania pars interior,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>ab ijs incolitur, quos natos in inſula ipſi memoria pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum dicunt. Maritima pars ab ijs, qui praedae ac belli inferendi cauſa ex Belgio tranſierant.</hi> The inner part of the ile is inhabited of ſuch people as were bred and borne there, as they themſelues do report from their anceſtours. The ſea coaſt is poſſeſſed of ſuch as haue come thither from Flanders and thereabout, to robbe and ſpoile the countrey. If this were all that was then knowen, and that Gildas Sapiens and Venerabilis Beda knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary, how came this our authour, ſo many hundred yeeres after them, to the knowledge of this ſo abſolute an hiſtory, where not only perſons, places, and actions are ſo diſtinctly ſet downe with their preciſe difference of time, as if they had beene done but yeſterday? The hiſtorian, for things done in his owne time, or not long before, is beleeued vpon his owne word, but for ſuch things as were done many ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was borne, he muſt bring his author to iuſtifie his aſſertion. If there had beene any ſuch tradition commonly deliuered from man to man, it would queſtionleſſe haue beene intimated to Caeſar. Records can not be preſerued but by writing; and that knowledge came in with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. But if it be a queſtion whether there were euer any ſuch city as that Troy, ſo much renowmed by meanes of that learned poëme of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Poët Homer, what will become of the ſtories of Aeneas (which, if I miſtake him not, the great Hiſtoriographer Titus Liuius doth make a doubt of) and of this our Brutus neuer patronaged by any great learned wiſe man? I know that is improued by ſome, and I thinke it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. For further ſatisfaction I referre thee to M. Camdens Britannia, where this argument is handled at large and moſt learnedly. Only in defence of Gaulfridus, leſt any man ſhould thinke that I haue all this while ſpoken againſt his perſon, I conclude with this ſayng of a learned man of our time; <hi>Cardanus ait,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>illius aetatis ſcriptores tantopere mendacio &amp; fabulis fuiſſe delectatos, vt in contentionem venerint quis plura con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingeret.</hi> Cardane ſayth, That the Hiſtorians and Writers of thoſe times (betweene foure hundred and fiue hundred yeeres ſince) were ſo much delighted with fables and lies, that they ſtroue who ſhould lie faſteſt, and win the whetſtone. It was, you ſee, the fault of the time and age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he liued, not of the man. The learned Oratour Tully, in the ſecond booke of his Offices, as I remember, thus deſcribeth the vertues of a true
<pb facs="tcp:23194:332"/> Hiſtoriographer: <hi>Ne quid falſi ſcribere audeat; Ne quid veri non audeat; Ne quam in ſcribendo ſuſpitionem gratiae; Ne quam ſimultatis oſtendat.</hi> A good Hiſtorian may not dare to write any thing that is falſe; He may not be afrayd to write any thing that is true; He muſt not ſhew any partiality or fauour in writing; He ought to be void of all affection and malice. Learned Antiquaries follow this good counſell of the graue Philoſopher; Sell vs no more droſſe for pure mettall; Refine what you reade and write; Euery tale is not true that is tolde: Some authours want iudgement; others honeſty: Let no man be beleeued for his antiquity: For you know what Menander ſayd, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <hi>Effradic:</hi> but I alter nothing. It is a very ancient citie oft mentioned in Roman Coines and hiſtories, whereby it is manifeſt that <hi>Legio ſexta victrix,</hi> the ſixth conquering legion, did ordinarily reſide in this city. The Emperours Seuerus and Conſtantius, father to Conſtantine the Great, ſo long as they abode in this ile, did keepe their court heere, and dying in theſe parts, were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, in this city. This Conſtantius being a very godly and religious Chriſtian Prince; made it firſt as our hiſtories report, a Biſhops ſea, which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius Biſhop of Rome, afterward aduanced vnto the dignity of a Metropolitane, or Archbiſhopricke, which, beſide the large iuriſdiction that it had heere in England, had alſo vnder it all Scotland.</p>

            <head>GALIZIA, a kingdome of Spaine.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He kingdome of GALIZIA is bounded vpon the Weſt and North, with the Ocean ſea; vpon the Eaſt, with the Aſturias and the kingdome of Leon: vpon the South, with the riuer Min<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o, and the Kingdome of Portingall. It was ſometime, as Ferdinand Oiea, the authour of this Mappe, writeth, much greater then now it is at this daie, and was then held to be one of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt kingdomes of all Spaine: For it extended it ſelfe Eaſtward vp as farre as the mountaines of Biſcaya, and the head of the great riuer Duero, (<hi>Durius</hi> Pliny calleth it) and ſo from thence it ranne all along by the banke of this riuer euen till where it falleth into the maine ſea, as our ſaid authour prooueth, by the teſtimony of Marius Aretius in his deſcription of Spaine, of Annius Viterbius, and Floriano de Campo in the 40. chapter of his fourth booke; and likewiſe in the third chapter of his fourth booke. It is very vneuen, and mounteinous, or euery where full of dry barrein hils and dales; and therfore much of it, by reaſon it wanteth water, is waſte and not inhabited. Their Villages and townes, (eſpecially the greater and better ſort of them,) are ſituate vpon the Sea, or vpon ſome great riuer not farre from thence, except San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiago, Lugo, and Mondon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>edo with one or two more. Yet, which is very ſtrange, heere are bred ſuch woonderfull ſtore of horſes, that that fable, which reporteth that hereabouts in Spaine the mares conceiue with foale by vertue of the winde, may ſeeme to be ſomething probable. Yea and this our authour Fernandez Oiea, ſaith, that it hath great ſtore of cattell, and of all manner of Deere aſwell for neceſſary prouiſion and mainteinance of the houſe, as for game and diſporte for the nobility and gentry of the land. But of Fiſh heere taken, not only in the Sea but alſo in the freſh riuers, there is ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and woonderfull ſtore that it is from hence conueighed to moſt places throughout all Spaine. It hath many hot bathes, and other ſprings and waters of rare and ſoueraigne vertues. It yeeldeth great plenty of wine, and that ſo good, eſpecially that which is made about Orenſe and Riuadauia, that it is tranſported from hence farre and neere into all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Chriſtian. It offordeth much good fruite of all ſorts, but eſpecially of Limons and Orenges. Silke and Flax, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great and gainefull commodities vnto the inhabitants. Heere were ſometime, as Pliny teſtifieth, very rich Mines of gold. And Niger writeth that, amongſt the Artabri, (who inhabited not farre from Cape finiſter,) the riuers and brooks did bring downe, after any great ſtore of raine, Earth mingled with Siluer, Tynne and Gold-ore: yea and that the ſoile heere was ſo fertile of Gold, Copper and Lead, that ofttimes the husbandmen with their ploughes did turne vp great cloddes of good gold. Yet we know now, ſaith Maginus, that the Mines of this country at this day are of no great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. It hath alſo ſome quarreis of fine marble. Pedro de Medina reckoneth vp threeſcore Cities and townes of note in Galizia, of which theſe following are the moſt famous and renowmed, and therefore the more worthy the ſpeaking of in this place. COMPOSTELLA, a goodly city ſituate betweene the two riuers Sar, and Sarela, is now commonly called and knowen by the name of SANTIAGO, <hi>Saint Ieameſes,</hi> for that the body of the glorious Apoſtle Saint Iames, elder brother to Iohn the Euangeliſt, who firſt preached the goſpel heere and planted Chriſtianity amongſt the Spaniards, lieth heere interred: and in honour of this bleſſed Apoſtle, by the conſent generally of all, Prince, Nobles and Prelates, it was long ſince adorned with the title and dignity of Metropolitan. This by-word is common amongſt the Spaniards, That there be three Apoſtolicall Churches in the world moſt renowmed and famous. Saint Peters in Rome, Saint Ieamſes in Spaine, and Saint Iohns in Epheſus. They commonly hold, that the firſt Church that euer was built in Spaine, was that of our Lady in Saragoſa, the ſecond was this of Saint Iames. Heere alſo is a goodly Vniuerſity and ſchoole of good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where all the Liberall Sciences are profeſſed and taught, and many ſtudents are brought vp and maintained vntill they come to be of age and abilitie for publike ſeruice either in the Church or Commonwealth. The GROINE, is a very goodly towne, ſituate in an iſthmos or demy-ile, betweene two baies or creeks of the ſea, whereof the one is held to be one of the beſt hauens of the world: And therefore heere for the moſt parte of the Kings ſhips, in time of peace doe lie at anchor. LVGO, one of the principall cities of all Galizia, ſtandeth vpon the Min<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o, not farre from Caſtro de Rey where this riuer ariſeth. It is very ancient, and was out of doubt, knowen to the Romans, at ſuch time they bore the ſway in theſe parts: yet there be ſome which doe thinke it to haue beene built by the Vandals, long ſince the decay of that eſtate. MONDONNEDO is a faire city ſeated vpon a little riuer toward the Northren ſea coaſt, not farre from Riuadeo. It was aunciently called <hi>Glandomiro.</hi> ORENSE, ſituate vpon the riuer Min<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o, is a very great and large citie. The wines that are heere made, are counted to be of the beſt, and equall to thoſe of Riuadauia. Some thinke that it was in old time called <hi>Auria,</hi> yet the Romans, as it is probable, called it <hi>Aquas Calidas,</hi> of the hotte bathes, which heere are founde, and are now of the Spaniards called <hi>Burgas.</hi> TVY, or, as ſome write it, <hi>Tuyd,</hi> built alſo vpon the riuer Min<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o, not farre from the maine Sea, was firſt founded, as they fable by certaine Greeks, who came hither from Troy with Diomedes. Lucius Marineus Siculus maketh BVRGOS to be a city of Galizia. His words are theſe: Burgos, ſaith he, is a very famous and ancient city of Galizia in Spaine. It was ſometime, as ſome authours reporte, called <hi>Maſburgi, Liconitiurgis, Brauum,</hi> and <hi>Auca,</hi> or as Pliny writeth it, <hi>Ceuca.</hi> It is a very rich and populous citie, much reſorted vnto by Gentlemen and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants: of the one ſorte for pleaſure, of the other for profit; and therefore it is euery day greatly enlarged with goodly and ſumptuous newe buildings. If thou deſire more of this city, I wiſh thee to repaire to George Braun his Theater of the chiefe cities of the world: If more of this kingdome, read Peter de Medina his <hi>Las Grandezas ycoſas notabiles de Eſpan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a,</hi> of the ſtrange and memorable things of Spaine; and I make no doubt, if not with truthes and good hiſtoricall diſcourſes, yet with tedious tales and fables, thou ſhalt haue thy belliefull.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>RANCE (or GALLIA, as the Latines called it,) at this day one of the goodlieſt and greateſt Kingdomes of Europe, hath notwithſtanding in forepaſſed ages, beene much larger then now it is. For in Iulius Caeſars time it conteined all that Weſterne part of the Maineland inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and poſſeſſed by the <hi>Belgae, Aquitani, Celtae</hi> and <hi>Heluetij,</hi> bounded vpon the North by the Rhein, vpon the Weſt by the maine Ocean ſea, vpon the South with the Pyreney mountaines, and vpon the Eaſt with the ſtately Alpes. For thus he writeth in the Firſt booke of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of the warres of France: GALLIA <hi>eſt omnis diuiſa in partes tres: Quarum vnam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colunt</hi> BELGAE, <hi>aliam</hi> AQVITANI, <hi>tertiam qui ipſorum lingua</hi> CELTAE, <hi>noſtra</hi> GALLI, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellantur. Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen, à Belgis Matrona, et Sequana diuidit.</hi> All FRANCE is diuided into three parts: whereof the one is poſſeſſed of the <hi>Belgae,</hi> the other of the <hi>Aquitani,</hi> the third of thoſe people which they in their language call <hi>Celtae,</hi> wee in ours <hi>Galli.</hi> The <hi>Galli</hi> (or <hi>Gaules</hi>) are diuided from the Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes by the riuer Garonne; and from the <hi>Belgae</hi> by the Marne and Seine. Item a little beneath hee ſaith that, GALLIA beginneth at the riuer Rhoſne, and it is bounded with the Garonne, the Ocean ſea, and Belgium; moreouer toward the Sequani and Heluetij it abbutteth vpon the Rhein: It bendeth ſomewhat Northward. BELGIVM beginneth at the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt borders of Gallia; and from thence it coſteth along by the inner ſide of the riuer Rhein: It lieth North and by Eaſt from the reſt of Gallia. AQVITANIA ariſeth at the riuer Garonne, and ſo from thence it falleth downe to the Pyreney mountaines, and the Spaniſh ſeas: It lieth Weſt and by North from the reſt of France. Nay beſide this diuiſion, there was yet another much more large, extending the bounds of France beyond the Alpes which did include a good part of Italy, and therefore it was of the Romans named GALLIA CISALPINA, Fraunce on this ſide the Alpes, or <hi>Italia Gallica,</hi> France in Italy. But of theſe and the like diuiſions we haue in the former ſpoken plentifully, and therefore we now ſurceaſe to repeat them againe in this place. And we are not ignorant how much of this large compaſſe heere deſcribed is at this day ſeuered from the crowne of France, and hath theſe many yeeres beene gouerned by ſeuerall Lords and Princes. A great part of Gallia Belgica, as namely Flaunders, Brabant, Artois, Limburgh and other) belongeth vnto the King of Spaine; Holland, Zeland, with the reſt of the Low-countries are gouerned by the States: Zuittzerland, Cleue, Lorrain, Alſas, Sauoy, Piemont, and ſome other prouinces are held of the Emperour, and are ſubiect to their proper Princes: and no one foote, for ought I know, of Italy beyond the Alpes doth belong now to the crowne or kingdome of France. The ſeuerall Shires or Prouinces of this kingdome are very many, whereof the moſt principall are theſe, Boulennois, Ponthieu, Caux, Picardy, Normandy, Fraunce, Beauſſe, Bretaigne, Aniow, Le Maine, Poitow, Lymoſin, Santoine, Guien, Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne, Perigot, Quercy, Champaine, Berrey, Gaſtinois, Sologne, Auuergne, Niuernois, Lyomois, Charrolois, Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonois, Maine, Daulphein, Prouince, Languedocke, Bloys, or Blaſois, Forram, Burgundy, La Franche Conte, Verman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois and ſome few others mentioned in this Mappe. The whole land generally is very fertile and withall paſſing pleaſant and healthfull: and thereupon they vſe to ſay that Lombardy is the garden of Italy, and France is the garden of Europe. Yet ſome places are more fertile for ſome one commodity then others are. Picardy, Normandy, and Languedocke are as goodly countries for Corne, as any in all Chriſtendome beſide. Some places doe afforde great ſtore of fruits, ſome as great plenty of Wood: In ſome places Flax and Hempe doe grow in great abundance, in other places they make as great a commoditie of their Woad. The whole countrey generally in all places affordeth much wine, but the beſt is made in Beauſſe about Orleans. They haue ſome mines of Iron, but many of Salt. Whereupon La Noüe ſaith, that the Corne, Wine, Salt and Woad that is from hence tranſported into forraine Countries, doth bring in yeerely to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and crowne of France twelue hundred thouſand pounds of currant mony. And Iohn Bodine affirmeth that Such ſprings of Corne, Salt and wine doe heere flow ſo copiouſly, that it is almoſt impoſſible to empty them or drawe them quit dry. Another, a country man of ours, a worthy gentleman and of as good iudgement, as the beſt of them, ſaith that in the prouince of Limoſin, are the beſt Beeues: about Orleans, the beſt Wines: in Auuergne, the beſt Swine; and in Berry, the choiſeſt Mutton, and greateſt ſtore of Sheepe. In France there are twelue Archbiſhoprickes: and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and foure Suffraganes, or Biſhops. Bodine ſaith that there are in France twentie ſeuen thouſand and foure hundred Pariſh Churches, counting onely euery city for a Pariſh. The cities and walled townes in this country are very many, but of them all PARIS is the chiefe, which doth as much excell the reſt, as the lofty cedar doth the loweſt ſhrubbes: And I haue heard ſay, if my memory faile me not, that the King of France, being demaunded by an Embaſſadour, how many cities there were in all that his whole country and kingdome, reckoned vp a great number, and amongſt them made no mention at all of Paris: and being againe asked the reaſon why he did not account that for one amongſt the reſt, anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Paris was another world. This towne is ſeated in the Ile of France vpon the riuer Sein, in as pleaſant and fertile a place as elſewhere may be found in this whole kingdome. It is a very ancient city, called by Caeſar <hi>Lutetia,</hi> by Ptolemey <hi>Lucotecia,</hi> and by Iulianus in his Miſopogonus, Leucetia. Zoſimus nameth it <hi>Pariſium,</hi> and Marcellinus, <hi>Caſtellum Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiorum,</hi> The caſtle of the Pariſij: For this prouince which now they call properly France, or The Ile of France, was the ancient ſeat and habitation of the Pariſij. The riuer Sein, <hi>(Sequana)</hi> parting it ſelfe into two ſtreames, diuideth this towne into three parts, to wit, The <hi>Burge</hi> vpon the North ſide: The <hi>Vniuerſity,</hi> vpon the South: and The <hi>Ville,</hi> in the middeſt, in the ile aforeſaid, which ſeemeth to be the old towne mentioned by Caeſar. For thus he writeth in the ſeuenth booke of his Commentaries of the warres of France: <hi>Id oppidum (Lutetia</hi> hee meaneth) <hi>Pariſiorum, poſitum in inſula fluminis Sequanae.</hi> Lutetia that towne of the Pariſij, is ſituate in an iland in the riuer Sein. It is, as our learned country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reporteth, tenne Engliſh miles about by the wals. The Vniuerſity was founded by Charles the Great in the yeere of our Lord eight hundred. For other particulars I wiſh thee to looke backe to that which we haue written before gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of France, or particularly of diuers and ſundry ſeuerall Prouinces of the ſame.

            <head>The Duchie of LIMBORGH, in the Low Countries.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ERMANIA INFERIOR, or, as we now call it, The Low countries, is at this day diuided into theſe ſeuenteene prouinces: to wit, foure <hi>Duchies,</hi> Brabant, Limbourgh, Lukenburgh &amp; Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland: ſeuen <hi>Counties,</hi> or <hi>Earldomes,</hi> Flanders, Artois, Heinault, Holland, Zeland, Namur, and Zurphen: one <hi>Marquiſate,</hi> commonly called The Marquiſate of the Sacred Empire: fiue <hi>Grand Signeories,</hi> Frizeland, Mechlin, Vtreckt, Ouer-iſſel, and Groninghen. Of the moſt of theſe we haue in the former ſpoken ſeuerally and at large, onely of Limborgh, which although it be one of the leaſt, yet in honor and dignity not the leaſt, we haue hitherto ſpoken little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The Dukedome of LIMBOVRGH, therefore, is a very little prouince, ſituate in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt betweene the Duchie of Gulich, Gelderland, the Biſhopricke of Leege and Lutzenburge: The citie Limburgh, or as they vulgarly call it <hi>Lympurch,</hi> the chiefe towne of this prouince and whereof it tooke the name, ſtandeth vpon the riuer Weſſe, or Weſdo, as they name it, and is diſtant from Aix three leagues, but from Leige it is foure at the leaſt or ſomewhat more. It is a very ſtrong towne both by nature and arte: For being built vpon the riſing of a ſtony hill, it is encloſed round with a very defenſible wall, garded heere and there with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſtrong towers, beſide a goodly large Caſtle all of free ſtone vpon the toppe of the hill. The ſituation and proſpect of this citie is moſt pleaſant and commendable. For at the foote of the hill, at the townes ſide, runneth the riuer, vnto which adioineth a goodly fertile plaine where daily great ſtore of cattell are kept and mainteined to the great commodity and gaine of the inhabitants round about. This city is not ancient, nor once mentioned by any old writer, as D. Remacle Fuſch, a learned Phyſician, this countriman borne, plainly confeſſeth, and yet he ſaith that hee had diligently ſearched and turned ouer all authours, who either of ſet purpoſe, or by the way, haue handled that kind of argument. The ſoile is very good and fertile, both for corne and paſture, eſpecially about Heruey, a fine village not farre from Clermont. Onely wine it yeeldeth none at all; but in ſted of that, they make of barley ſteeped and ſodden, a kinde of very ſtrong drinke, which will aſſoone make the toſſe-pot drunke, as the ſtrongeſt wine in France. Lewis Guicciardine writeth that, about halfe a Dutch mile off, from this towne, there is a Mine or quarry of ſtone, that is very like to mettall: of Pliny, in the 10. Chapter of the foure and thirtieth booke of his Naturall hiſtorie it is called <hi>Lapis aeroſus, Cadmia,</hi> and <hi>lapis calaminaris</hi> (if I be not deceiued) The braſſe ſtone, or Copper ore. D. Fuſch teſtifieth that it hath alſo diuerſe veines of Lead and Iron. A kinde of blacke ſtone cole, like vnto that which we heere call Seacoale, of a ſulphurous nature, a good fuell and much vſed of Farriers and Smithes, is in diuers places of the country digged out of the ground in great abundance. Moreouer heere are found diuers ſorts of ſtone, not much vnlike to Marble or Iaſper party coloured, very beautiful and good for buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. This countrey at the firſt was no more but a County or Earldome: vntill that Fredericke, ſurnamed Barbaroſſo, in the yeere of our Lord 1172. graced it with the title and dignity of a Duchie. The firſt Duke that enioied this honor was Henry the Firſt, lineally deſcended from Henry the Fourth, that valiant and religious Emperour. At length Henry the Second Duke of Limburgh, dying without heire male, Iohn the Firſt Duke of Brabant, about the yeere after Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation 1293, by right of inheritance claimed the ſame, and by dint of ſworde, driuing out Reynold Earle of Gelderland, the Vſurper, obteined it, ſince whoſe daies it hath beene quietly poſſeſſed by the houſe of Brabant. Therefore for iuſtice in ciuill cauſes, not only Limburg, but alſo Faulconburg, Dalem and other liberties and free townes beyond the Moſe, do come to the courts of Brabant, which ordinarily are held at Bruſſels: otherwiſe for eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction they doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the dioceſſes of that Biſhop of Leige. But beſide this dukedome of Limburgh there are diuers other Iurſdictions and Signiories deſcribed in this Charte; of the which theſe following are the chiefe, whereof it ſhal not be amiſſe to ſpeake a word or two. <hi>Faulconburgh, (Valckembourg</hi> it is called of the Dutch, but of the French, <hi>Fauquemont</hi>) is a very prety towne, which hath iuriſdiction and command ouer a large circuite of ground conteining many fine villages. It is three great Dutch miles from Aix, and but two ſmall miles from Maſtricht. It was conquered and taken by Iohn the third, Duke of Brabant; who ouercame Ramot the Lord of Faulconburgh, a troubleſome man, that at that time laid ſeege to Maſtricht and had much and oft vexed the country round about him. DALEM is a prety fine towne, with a Caſtle, but of no great ſtrength. It is three long miles from Aix, and two from Liege: It was honoured with the title of an Earldome, and had iuriſdiction and command ouer many villages and a great circuit of ground vp as high as the riuer of Moſe. Henry the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Duke of Brabant conquered it and adioined it to his dominions. ROIDVCK, or, as Guicciardin calleth it <hi>Rhode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-duc,</hi> is an ancient little towne with an old Caſtle, about one long Dutch mile, as the forenamed authour would haue it, from Faulconburg: yet this our Mappe maketh it about two. AIX or AIX LACHAPELLE, if we may beleeue Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, was that which the Latines called <hi>Aquiſgranum</hi> ſo much ſpoken of and mentioned in the ſtories of Charles the Great and others of thoſe times. Others would haue it to be that which Ptolemey in the 9 chapter of the ſecond booke of his Geography calleth <hi>Veterra,</hi> and where he ſaith the thirtieth Legion, called <hi>Vlpia legio</hi> did reſide. Limprand nameth it <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais de Grau,</hi> Rheginon, <hi>Palais de eaux,</hi> that is, the Water palace; which in my iudgement ſeemeth moſt probable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find that that city in Prouence in France which the Romans called <hi>Aquae Sextiae,</hi> the Frenchmen do at this day call <hi>Aix.</hi> This city is ſituate betweene Brabant, Limburgh, the Duchie of Gulicke, and the Biſhopricke of Liege. Some thinke that it was deſtroied and laid leuell with the ground by Attila king of the Humes: others thinke that it was firſt founded by Charles the Great. But to leaue all theſe as doubtfull, this is certeine that it ſtandeth in a moſt pleaſant plaine and as healthfull and ſweet an aire, as any may be elſwhere found in theſe parts. That faire Church, of our Sauiour and the bleſſed Virgin his mother, was built by this Emperour, and by him was endowed with great lands, priuiledges, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy and precious reliques brought thither from ſundry places of the world. Beatus Rhenanus writeth that Charles the Great made it the head and chiefe city of the kingdome of France, and generally of all the whole Empire, the ordinary Court and place of reſidence for the Emperour in theſe Weſterne parts of the ſame. Moreouer he ordained that heere the Emperour ſhould, by the Biſhop of Collen, Metropolitan of this prouince, be crowned with a crown of Iron: at Millan, with a crowne of Siluer; and at Rome with a crowne of Gold. Ouer one of the doores of the Towne-houſe are written theſe ſix Latine verſes, <hi>Carolus inſignem reddens hanc condidit vrbem, Quam libertauit poſt Romam: conſtituendo, Quòd ſit trans Alpes hic ſemper regia ſedes: Vt caput vrbs cuncta colat hanc, &amp; Gallia tota. Gaudet Aquiſgranum prae cunctis munere clarum, Quae prius imperij leges nunc laureat almi.</hi> And ouer another doore, theſe two, <hi>Hîc ſedes regni trans Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes habeatur, Caput omnium ciuitatum, &amp; prouinciarum Galliae.</hi> This famous Emperour hauing reigned ouer the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men 47. yeares and worne the imperiall diadem 14. ended his life in the yeere of our Lord 813. and was heere enterred in a tombe of Marble, in our Ladies Church with this plaine epitaph; <hi>Caroli Magni Chriſtianiſsimi, Romanorum Imperatoris Corpus hoc conditum eſt ſepulchro.</hi> That is, the body of Charles the Great, Emperour of the Romans, lieth heere inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this tombe. Thus farre Guicciardine, to whom I wiſh thee to repaire if thou deſire a larger diſcourſe of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſatisfie your requeſt concerning the Name and ſituation of the ile MONA, moſt learned Ortell, and to ſet downe in writing what I haue obſerued of that argument in the reading of ancient and moderne authours, what I haue found by experience and trauell, and what I haue gathered by the knowledge of the Britiſh tongue which to this day is ſpoken vulgarly by the inhabitants of this iland, were but ſo much as I confeſſe is due to your kinde loue and manifold courteſies, whereby you haue many wayes eternally bound me vnto you: Notwithſtanding in ſo doing I am ſure to be ſeuerely cenſured of many, condemned of ſome, and generally to be ſubiect and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the obloquy, and ſcandalous ſpeeches of the baſer ſort, ſuch I mean as haue no maner of learning or ſound iudgement. For a preiudicate opinion, though neuer ſo falſe and abſurd, nay euen the groſſeſt errors if they be once receiued and ſetled in the heart, will hardly euer be remoued, eſpecially being patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged and defended by the authority of Polydore Virgil, a graue learned man, and one that for thoſe times was accounted very eloquent. But by their leaue I may ſay, That this man hath ſtuffed his Hiſtories with many manifeſt errours, <hi>mille mendis &amp; mendacijs,</hi> with a thouſand faults and falſhoods; which he fell into, not only for that he wanted the knowledge of the Britiſh tongue, (which now the Engliſh, after the maner of the Germans, call Welſh, that is, Strange or Barbarous) without which euen the very name of the iland can by no meanes be truely vnderſtood: But alſo either for that he neuer read the beſt of our Authours, or els for that he bearing a proud ſplene and malice againſt the Britons, (whom the beſt and moſt honorable of all the Romane Emperours did loue and greatly eſteeme) little weighed their authority, and haughtilie attributing too much to his owne, neglected the better, and followed the ſteps, poore blinde man, of one William Little, little in name and little in eſtimation and credit, as blinde a foole as himſelfe. But let this braſen faced diminiſher of the Britons honour, burſt himſelfe if he will, and do what he can to the vttermoſt of his might and malice, ſo long as Diodorus Siculus, Dion Caſsius, twiſe Conſul of Rome, Herodian, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Pauſanias, Ptolemey and Strabo, are extant amongſt the Greekes; Caeſars Commentaries, Tacitus his Annals, Eutropius, Suetonius, Oroſius, Aelius Spartianus, Iulius Capitolinus, Aelius Lampridius, Flaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Vopiſcus, Aurelius Victor, Ammianus Marcellinus, Sextus Rufus, The Panegyricks of Mamertinus and others, Pliny, Antonine, Mela and Solinus, amongſt the Latines; beſide the Annals of the three Gildaſes, Ninnius, and diuers other very learned men, written many hundred yeres ſince in the Britiſh tongue, who before the comming of the Engliſh, (which our countreymen to this day call by their ancient name, <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>) haue learnedly penned the hiſtories of this their natiue countrey: and beſide Aſſerius, Obbern, Felix Monumetenſis, Henricus Huntingtonenſis, Malmesburienſis, Annouillanus, Iſcanus, Neccham, Gyraldus Pariſienſis, Trenetus, and infinite others, which ſince thoſe Saxons conquered that part of the iland, (which they call England, but we, reteining the old name Lhoëgria,) haue done the like. Let, I ſay, this proud Italian burſt himſelfe, and let him ſnarle at the worthy acts of the Britons, while ſo many, and ſuch ancient authours do liue to ſound the trumpe of their honour, no impudent lying fellow ſhall euer be able with his calumnies to obſcure the bright luſture of the Britons glory, to impeach the honourable fame of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed deeds, ſpread abroad by ſuch worthy men, or to faſten the leaſt infamy vpon them. But now it is time to come to our propoſed argument, and to ſpeake more particularly of MONA, which Polydore Virgil, taking vpon him more than he well might, hath depriued of the ancient name, and leauing it name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, hath giuen both it and Menauia, to the Ile of Man, as may thus be proued both out of the Greeke, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and Britiſh writers, as alſo out of the language which here to this day is ſpoken by the inhabitants. It is apparent out of Caeſar, Tacitus, and others, that MONA was an iland very neere to the coaſt of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, betweene it and Ireland: In which Sea there are but two (beſide the Hebrides) that are of any note and bigneſſe: Therefore it muſt needs follow, that one of thoſe two is that MONA which is ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ancient hiſtories: Wherefore I thinke it not amiſſe to ſet downe before your eyes the poſition of them both, and how they do lie from the coaſt of England &amp; other ilands round about them, that by that meanes that which followeth may the better be vnderſtood. The firſt of theſe, which Polydore calleth ANGLESEY, is very neere to that part of Britaine, which we call <hi>Cumry,</hi> and the Engliſh, <hi>Wales,</hi> from which it is ſeuered by a very narrow frith or bay of the ſea, (the countrey people call it <hi>Menai</hi>) which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the middeſt of the iland, is hardly a mile ouer. Vpon the Eaſt ſide of this ile there is a very ſtrong caſtle, and a prety fine citie, called Beaumariſh, <hi>(Bellum mariſcum)</hi> both built by Edward the Firſt, King of
<pb facs="tcp:23194:340"/> England. On the other ſide of the iland, oppoſite to this city, there is a maruellous conuenient place to take ſhipping for Ireland, and therefore it is much for that purpoſe reſorted vnto and frequented by the Engliſh. They call it <hi>Holy-head,</hi> but of the Welſh men it is called <hi>Caërgybi,</hi> that is, Gubcheſter, or, The citie of Kybi. In this iland is <hi>Aberfraw,</hi> which within theſe three or foure hundred yeeres was the chiefe ſeat where ordinarily the King of Northwales, (<hi>Gwynedia,</hi> or as ſome barbarouſly write it <hi>Venedocia</hi>) did reſide and keepe his Court. This iland, for the bigneſſe of it, mainteineth and breedeth much <hi>cattell</hi> and <hi>ſheepe.</hi> It yeerely yeeldeth ſuch plentie of <hi>wheat,</hi> that in reſpect of that fertility it is commonly called, <hi>The mother of Wales.</hi> They haue little wood here growing: yet euery day the bodies of huge trees, with their roots, and ſirre trees of a woonderfull length and bigneſſe, are heere by the inhabitants found and digged out of the earth in diuers places, in low grounds and champion fields. The people ſpeake the Welſh tongue, and for the moſt part they do not vnderſtand one word of Engliſh: notwithſtanding they haue for theſe three hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres and more beene ſubiect, as the reſt of Wales hath beene, to the Kings and Crowne of England. But now let vs come to the other iland, to which alſo Polydore Virgil hath not long ſince without any ground or good authoritie, giuen the name of MONA. That ſtandeth in the middeſt of the maine ſea, diſtant from the neereſt place of England at the leaſt fiue and twentie miles. It is almoſt as bigge as that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it is farre more barren and waſte, and thoſe men that are borne and bred there, are weake and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo fit for the warres and ſeruice in the field, only thoſe excepted that are ſent thither by the Earle of Darbie, to whom this ile doth by right of inheritance from his anceſtours belong. They do ſpeake the Scotiſh language, or the Iriſh, as you pleaſe to call it, for they be both one. The one is as farre from Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as the other. Theſe things being taught and conceiued, let vs now heare what the Romans haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>Mona.</hi> The firſt authour that euer made mention of it, as I remember, was Caeſar; next after him, Pliny and Dion Caſsius: But they doe but name it only, and withall affirme it to be ſituate in the maine ſea betweene England and Ireland. Thus much we both confeſſe. Cornelius Tacitus, a very learned man, and one that by meanes of Iulius Agricola, his father in law, very well knew the ſtate of Britaine then, of the ſituation and diſtance of Mona from the Continent, teacheth vs many things making much to this our purpoſe. Therefore let vs liſten awhile to that which he ſpeaketh in the foureteenth booke of his Annals: <hi>But then was Paulinus Suetonius Lieutenant of Britaine, one that for his great experience and knowledge of militarie matters, popular fame, and eſtimation amongst the meaner ſort of men, (which for the most part ſuffereth no man of rare virtues and qualities to liue without a compere) did alwayes contend with Corbulo, labouring by all meanes poſsiblie to match that his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeruice in conquering Armenia, by ouercomming and quieting thoſe Rebels which in theſe parts did ſtand out against the Romans. Therefore he maketh great preparation, and prouideth all things neceſſarie for the aſſault and taking of the iland</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>a place not only by nature, but alſo by reaſon of the multitude of people which do there inhabit, very ſtrong and defencible, and is indeed the ſanctuarie and place of common refuge for all ſuch as runne away from their Capteines or Commanders. He cauſed boats to be made with flat bottomes, becauſe the ſea there neere the ſhore is verie ſhallow, and euerie where full of flats and ſhelfs. Thus they conueyed ouer the footmen, the horſmen followed them partly wading thorow the foords and ſhallow pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and partly ſwimming where the waters were more deepe. Vpon the ſhore, to empeach our landing, a very great armie, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well appointed and armed for all aſſaies, ſtood cloſe thronging together, intermedled with women running to and fro betweene the ranks with torches in their hands, in mourning gownes and their haire about their eares, of all the world like to the Furies or madde women. The Druides alſo on euerie ſide with hands lifted vp to heauen, powring out many bitter curſes and deadlie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation, with the ſtrangeneſſe of that ſight ſtrooke the ſouldiers into ſuch a dampe, that they ſtood ſtone ſtill, not once moouing their bodies, as if they had willingly offered their throats to the enemie: yet at length by the exhortation and encouragement of the Generall, and one animating and heartening on another, that they might not ſeeme to be afrayd of a companie of ſeelie women and other frantike people, they aduance forward the ſtanderd, display their banners, and ſuch as offered to reſist, they beat to the ground, and force them to runne into their owne fires. This being done, he placed garriſons in their townes and villages, and cauſed their woods to be cut downe and vtterlie deſtroyed; which, by reaſon of their cruell ceremonies and ſuperſtitious ſacrifices there offered, were by them eſteemed holy. For they accounted it lawfull to embrue their altars wth the blood of their captiues, and to ſeeke to know the ſecret counſell of the eternall God and euents to come by the entrailes and bowels of men.</hi> Thou heareſt, gentle Reader, how the footmen followed the horſmen in the foords and ſhallowes, and where the water was more deepe, they ſwomme ouer with the horſes. The ſame Authour alſo, ſetting forth, in the life of Iulius Agricola, the ſame Agricola's voyage into this iland, writeth on this maner: MONAM <hi>inſulam, cuius poſſeſsionem reuocatum Paulinum, &amp;c.</hi> Thus tranſlated by the learned Sir Henrie Sauile (for I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Great Tacitus ſcorneth any other interpretor or no) <hi>He deliberated to conquer the iland</hi> Mona: <hi>from the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion whereof, as before I haue rehearſed, Paullinus was reuoked by the generall rebellion of Britanie: But as in a purpoſe not purpoſed before, ſhips being wanting, the policie and reſoluteneſſe of the Captaine deuiſed a paſſage, commanding the moſt choiſe of the Aides, to whom all the ſhallowes were knowen, and who after the vſe of their countrey were able in ſwimming to gouerne themſelues with armour and horſes, laying aſide their cariage, to put ouer at once, and ſuddenly to inuade them. VVhich thing ſo amaſed the enemie, attending for ſhips and ſuch prouiſion by ſea, that ſurely beleeuing nothing could be hard or inuincible to men which came ſo minded to warre, they humbly intreated for peace, and yeelded the Iland. Thus Agricola at his firſt entrance into his prouince (which time others conſume in vaine oſtentation and ambitious ſeeking of ceremonies) entring withall into labours and dangers, became famous indeed and of great reputation.</hi> Here thou ſeeſt againe, how the ſouldiers gat into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na by ſwimming without the helpe of any ſhips or boats. Neither did this our authour heare this from the
<pb facs="tcp:23194:340"/> report of any obſcure fellow of little knowledge and leſſe vnderſtanding in theſe matters, but euen from the mouth of Agricola himſelfe, his wiues father, a man very famous, and one that was the Generall and chiefe commander in this voyage. But marke, I pray you, how Polydore Virgil anſwereth all this: For thus he writeth in the firſt booke of his Hiſtorie of England. This ſometime (he ſpeaketh of Mona) was ſeuered from Britaine by a very narrow arme of the ſea, ſo that ſo oft as the ſea did ebbe, which heere at all times maketh very high tides, it was ſo neere to the Continent, that men might go thither without boats. And againe, a little beneath he writeth thus of it: See, ſayth he, what continuance of time can bring to paſſe, That iland is now fiue and twentie miles from any part of England, which ſometime was ſcarſe one mile from it. What will not malice, and a croſſe humour alwaies oppoſing it ſelfe againſt other mens opinions, although neuer ſo much turning to his owne diſgrace and diſcredit, yea euen in the beſt wits, force a man to do! This Italian dreameth of a ſtrange inundation and ouerflowing of the ſea, whereof neuer any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, Latine, Engliſh, Iriſh or Scotiſh euer ſpake, I dare auouch, one word: and that which is moſt ſtrange of all, the countrey people neuer haue heard, as ſeemeth, from their anceſtours, of any ſuch kinde of drowning. He complaineth alſo of the ſtraightneſſe of that other iland, and of the ſcarſitie of Corne and Wood. Where alſo I could wiſh that the Authour had had a little more diſcretion and honeſtie: For this iland (I meane his Angliſea, which indeed is the true Mona) is about fiue and twentie Engliſh miles long, and ſixteene miles ouer, euery mile containing one thouſand and two hundred Geographicall paſes. Therefore it conteineth in compaſſe well neere threeſcore and twelue Italian miles: For in ſome places it is not full ſixteene miles ouer. That which he ſpeaketh of the ſcarſitie of wood here, it is very true: For Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus reporteth that the woods were cut downe and deſtroyed by the Romans, an infinite number of the bodies of which, as I haue ſhewed before, couered with earth and hid within the ground, are at this day by the countrey people found in ſundry places of the ile. And that there haue beene woods here within theſe foure hundred yeeres or thereabouts, it is very manifeſt by our hiſtories. Of the barrenneſſe of this Iland I know not well what to ſay, ſeeing that he is not aſhamed to write that which all men do know to be moſt falſe: For ſuch is the fertilitie of this iland, that our people vſe to ſay prouerbially, that Angleſey is the mother of Wales <hi>(Mon mam Gymry.)</hi> Moreouer, the inhabitants (for their proportion, and ſtate of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) are verie wealthie, and withall, ſtout and valiant, as appeareth out of the Engliſh Hiſtoriographers: For the Engliſh men haue oft times aſſaulted this iland by ſea, and laboured to get the poſſeſsion thereof, but all in vaine: For they haue been alwaies there ſlaine, or put to the worſt. This, Hugh Earle of Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie and Arundell there ſlaine, can teſtifie to be true. This alſo Henrie the naturall ſonne of Henrie the Firſt, with many noble men with him there ſlaine can well teſtifie. [How true this is I can not tell; but this I finde, that two Hughs of the Norman blood, the one Earle of Cheſter, the other Earle of Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, did enter this iland, greatly vexe the inhabitants; and that they might the better retaine them in due obedience, did build the caſtle at Aber Lhienioc: and of theſe two, Hugh Earle of Cheſter was indeed there ſlaine: but how? not in the entrance or aſſault of the ile, but in the defence of it after he had gotten quiet poſſeſsion of the ſame? yet not by the Welſh men, but by the Norweighians, who vnder the conduct of Magnus their Generall landed heere, ſlew many of the people, robbed the countrey, and departed with great ſpoile. Of that Henrie I finde not one word in others.] What ſhould I ſay more? Polydore Virgils Mona diſtant from the coaſt of Britaine twentie fiue miles, no whit bigger than this, but much more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and ſuch as breedeth a weaker kinde of men deſcended from the Iriſh, euen by the iudgement of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore himſelfe, doth now renounce the title of Mona. But what other men alſo do thinke of this matter, let vs heare in few words. Ptolemey the Prince of Geographers, vpon the Eaſt ſide of Ireland placeth foure i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, MONARINA (or as other copies do reade, <hi>Monaida</hi>) MONA, ADROS and LYMNOS. The two latter are very well knowen vnto vs at this day; for that indeed they doe ſtill reteine thoſe auncient names. Adros of our countrey men is called <hi>Ynys ador,</hi> that is, as the words doe ſignifie, <hi>The iland of birds.</hi> Lymnos they now call <hi>Enlli,</hi> which the Engliſh men call <hi>Bardeſey,</hi> that is, as he would faine interpret it, <hi>Inſula Bardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> The Bardes iland. [But I doubt whether our Saxons did euer vnderſtand what the Britons <hi>Bardi</hi> meant: yet of this I am ſure, that the learned M. Camden in his Britannia is of another opinion.] Of the other two then, the one muſt of neceſsity be our Mona, the other Polydores Mona. Monaria is by Ptolemey placed much farther Northward than Mona, and Mona hee maketh to lie ſomewhat more Eaſterly than Monaria: For this, Monaria, I meane, or Monaoeda, as Ptolemeyes copies vulgarly haue it, lieth, as he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, from the Canaries Eaſtward 17 degrees and 40 minutes, but vp ſo high into the North, that the pole there is eleuated aboue the horizont 61 degrees and 30 minutes: when as the other, to wit, Mona, lieth from the Canaries but 15 degrees, and from the North but 57 degrees and 40 minutes. Polydores Mona leaneth both more toward the North and Eaſt than ours doth: Therefore it is Ptolemeys Monaria that he ſpeaketh of, not Ptolemeys Mona. And this our Mona ſhall ſtill reteine that ancient name of Mona, which Ptolemey gaue vnto it in his time. This we haue collected out of forreine hiſtories: Now let vs come to our owne Writers, who I thinke, in a matter of names of places in their owne country and language ought rather to be beleeued than an Italian, a meere ſtranger borne and brought vp beyond the ſeas, farre from this our countrey. But that theſe things may the better be vnderſtood, ſome few lines are here by the way to be inſerted. All men do know and confeſſe this to be true, that the Britons, before the entrance of the
<pb facs="tcp:23194:341"/> Engliſh or Saxons did poſſeſſe this whole iland: vntill ſuch time as being by them conquered and ſubdued, they were forced to abandon the better part of the ſame, leauing it to the poſſeſsion of their enemies; and to content themſelues with the Weſtern parts only: And they being thus ſeated, were called by the names of the places were they dwelt, as for example thoſe which poſſeſſed Cambria, were named <hi>Cambri:</hi> thoſe which inhabited <hi>Cornouia,</hi> were knowen and called by the name of the <hi>Cornouij.</hi> Yet the Engliſh men did, after the maner of the Dutch (who name the French and Italians, <hi>VVelſh</hi>) call them all generally <hi>VVelſhmen:</hi> Adding for difference ſake the names of the countries, as it is manifeſt by thoſe hiſtories, which yet are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, written in the Saxon tongue. For thoſe our <hi>Brits,</hi> are in them called <hi>VValae:</hi> and the Cornouij, <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walae;</hi> not, as the vnlearned do thinke, <hi>Cornugalliae.</hi> Neither can I with ſilence ouerpaſſe that ſhameleſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie of Polydore, who braggeth that he was the firſt that euer found this out, and committed the ſame to writing; when it is moſt certeine that he ſtole this etymologie and reaſon why this our countrie was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wales, out of Sylueſter Giraldus. But, that I may returne vnto that where I left, the Welſhmen being thus cooped vp into a corner, did notwithſtanding reteine the ancient Britiſh tongue: ſo that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Cities, Riuers, Ilands, and people of Britaine, are by the Welſhmen called by thoſe names whereby they were knowen and called at ſuch time as they poſſeſſed the whole. For our countrey people, ſuch I meane as are borne and brought vp farre within the land, do not know what the name of an Engliſh man doth meane, but all the Engliſh they do generally terme <hi>Saiſſon,</hi> that is, Saxons, (for they haue no <hi>x</hi>) Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land they call by the ancient name <hi>Lhoëger:</hi> Wales, <hi>Cambri:</hi> Cornwall, <hi>Corniw:</hi> Scotland, <hi>Alban:</hi> Ireland, <hi>Yuerdhon:</hi> and indeed ſome old Writers do write the name of this iland not <hi>Hibernia,</hi> but <hi>Iuernia,</hi> as M. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſheweth at large in his Britannia. So alſo we doe ſtill call all the Cities of England by thoſe names whereby they were ſometime called before the entrance of the Saxons. But let vs come againe to Mona. Our countreymen and the inhabitants of this ile (ſpeaking now at this day the ancient Britiſh tongue) doe know no other name of it than MON, for ſo they all generally call it. Polydore Virgil calleth it ANGLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEA, that is, The Engliſh ile. I grant that this iland being ſubdued by the Engliſh men, was beautified and graced with their name, and that the Engliſh men do ſo call it I do not denie. But, I pray thee, did the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men firſt deſcrie this iland, was it neuer ſeene before, or had it no name at all before their comming? Heareſt thou Polydore, bethinke thy ſelfe; thou mayeſt aſwell ſay that England is not that land which was ſometime called Britannia, nor that was not Gallia, which now we call France. Nay, which is a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than this, and more ſtrange, the inhabitants of this ile (notwithſtanding they be ſubiect to the crowne of England) do neither know what England or an Engliſh man doth meane: For an Engliſh man they call <hi>Sais,</hi> (but in the plurall number ſpeaking of more than one, <hi>Saiſſon</hi>) and this their natiue countrey they name <hi>Mon.</hi> Moreouer, that faire citie built vpon that arme of the ſea or frith, aboue mentioned, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ouer againſt the Weſt part of this iland, is called <hi>Caeraruon,</hi> that is, The citie vpon Mon: For Caer, in our language ſignifieth a walled towne; (<hi>Kir,</hi> in Hebrew is a wall, and <hi>Kartha,</hi> in thoſe Eaſterne tongues is a walled citie:) <hi>Ar,</hi> is as much to ſay, as Vpon: and as for the <hi>v,</hi> in the laſt ſyllable, for <hi>m,</hi> that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of the language in ſome caſes: for in all words beginning with <hi>m,</hi> in conſequence of ſpeech, that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after ſome certeine conſonants is changed into <hi>v,</hi> for which our nation doth alwayes vſe <hi>f:</hi> becauſe that <hi>v,</hi> with them is euermore a vowell: So we call Wedneſday <hi>(Diem Mercurij) Die Mercher,</hi> but Wedneſday night <hi>Nos Fercher.</hi> Mary, we call <hi>Mair;</hi> but for our Ladies church we write and pronounce <hi>Lhanuair.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this citie only thus named, but euen that whole tract of the continent of Britaine that runneth along by it is called <hi>Aruon,</hi> that is, Oppoſite or ouer againſt Mon. But let it be, that this iland was not that Mona ſo oft mentioned by the ancients, then ought Polydore for his credits ſake haue found another name for it, and not to haue left it wholly nameleſſe. Now let vs come vnto the other, which our countreymen do call MENAW: and which all the inhabitants generall, as alſo the Engliſh and Scots (reteining the Welſh name, but cutting it ſomewhat ſhorter) MAN. Therefore there is no man, for ought I know, beſide this proud Italian, and one Hector Boëthius, a loud liar, that euer called this iland by the name of Mona. But leauing theſe demonſtrable arguments, which indeed do make this matter more cleere than the noone day, let vs come vnto authorities and teſtimonies of learned men, which in ſome caſes are rather beleeued than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments whatſoeuer: by theſe I doubt not but the true and proper name ſhall be giuen to ech of theſe ilands, and the controuerſie decided without any maner of contradiction. There is a piece of Gildas Britannus, that ancient writer, a man euery kinde of way learned, at this day remaining, in the Librarie of the illuſtrious Earle of Arundell, the only learned Noble man of his time; in which he hath theſe wordes: England hath three ilands belonging to it: Wight, ouer againſt the Armoricanes, or Bretaigne in France: The ſecond lieth in the middeſt of the ſea betweene Ireland and England. The Latine Hiſtorians doe call it <hi>Eubonia,</hi> but vulgarly in our mother tongue we call it MANAW. Thou heareſt, gentle Reader, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Welſh man ſpeaking in the Welſh tongue: For thus we call Polydore Virgils Mona in our natiue lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage euen at this day. Moreouer, the reuerend Beda, that worthy Engliſhman, famous thorow all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome in his dayes for all maner of literature and good learning, in the ninth chapter of the ſecond booke of his Hiſtorie writeth thus: At which time alſo the people of Northumberland <hi>(Nordan Humbri)</hi> that is, all that nation of the Angles which did inhabit vpon the North ſide of the riuer Humber, with Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win their king, by the preaching of Paulinus (of whom we haue ſpoken a little before) was conuerted vnto
<pb facs="tcp:23194:341"/> the faith of Chriſt. This king in taking of good ſucceſſe for his enterteinment of the Goſpel, did grow ſo mightie in Chriſtianitie and the kingdome of heauen, and alſo had that command vpon the earth, that he ruled (which neuer any king of the Engliſh did before him) from one end of Britaine to the other, and was king not only of the Engliſh but alſo of all the ſhires and prouinces of the Britons. Yea and he brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſubiection, as I haue ſhewed before, the iles of Man <hi>(inſulae Menaniae.)</hi> Here I do thinke, that for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauiae,</hi> it ought to be written <hi>Menauiae:</hi> ſeeing that there is ſuch ſmall difference betweene an <hi>n</hi> and a <hi>u,</hi> that they may eaſily be miſtaken, and one put for another. Moreouer, Henry Archdeacon of Huntingdon, a worthy Hiſtoriographer, who wrote about the yeere of our Lord 1140, one that followed Beda in many things almoſt foot for foot, doth ſeeme alſo to correct this fault, and cleere the doubt. For he ſetting forth the great command and conqueſts of this Edwine King of the Northumbers, bruſteth out into theſe words: Eduwyn the king of the Northumbers ruled ouer all Britaine, not only ouer that part which was inhabited of the Engliſh, but ouer that alſo which was poſſeſſed of the Britons, Kent only excepted. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, he brought the ile <hi>Menauia,</hi> which lieth between Ireland and Britaine, and is commonly called MAN, vnder the obedience of the Kings of England. Here obſerue, that this Engliſh man did giue alſo to this i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (which Polydore Virgil falſly calleth Mona) the Engliſh name: for it is commonly, ſayth he, called <hi>Man:</hi> by which name it is knowen &amp; called at this day of all the Engliſh. Beſides this alſo Ranulph of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the foure and fortieth chapter of the firſt booke of his Polychronicon, doth thus ſpeake of thoſe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands which are neere neighbours vnto Britaine: Britaine, ſayth he, hath three ilands lying not farre off from it (beſide the Orkney iles) which doe ſeeme to anſwer vnto the three principall parts of the ſame: For WIGHT lieth hard vpon the coaſt of <hi>Loëgria,</hi> which now is called England <hi>(Anglia:)</hi> MONA which the Engliſh call Angliſea, perteineth vnto <hi>Cambria,</hi> that is, to Wales: But the ile EVBONIA, which hath two other names, <hi>Menauia</hi> and <hi>Mania,</hi> lieth oueragainſt Scotland. Theſe three, Wight, Man, and Angliſea <hi>(Vecta, Mania, Mona)</hi> are almoſt all of one bigneſſe, and conteining the like quantitie of ground. Thus farre Ranulph of Cheſter. The reaſon why Gildas and others haue called this iland <hi>Eubonia,</hi> I take to be this; becauſe it was firſt inhabited of the ſame nation (to wit, the Iriſh) of the which the <hi>Euboniae,</hi> the Weſt iles, commonly of the Hiſtorians called <hi>Hebrides,</hi> are. The reuerend Beda and Henry Huntington, in that they write it <hi>Menauia,</hi> do ſeeme to allude to the Welſh name <hi>Manaw:</hi> but this is it which we would haue thee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to obſerue, that none of them do call it Mona. By theſe arguments and teſtimonies it is manifeſt that <hi>Mona</hi> is that iland which the inhabitants (as I haue ſhewed before) doe at this day name <hi>Mona,</hi> or Mon, acknowledging no other name, and is that which of the Engliſh is called Angliſea: but the other, which Polydore Virgil, and ſuch as doe loue with him to wallow in the mire, rather than to ſeeke for the cleere ſtreames, doe call Mona, is of Gildas called <hi>Eubonia,</hi> of Henry Huntington <hi>Menauia,</hi> and of others <hi>Mania.</hi> Here I will conclude this diſcourſe with this one teſtimonie, which may indeed woorthily ſtand for many; to wit, this of Sylueſter Girald a Welſh man borne, a man no leſſe famous for his learning, than for his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble birth: For he was deſcended from that noble houſe of the Giralds, to whom the Kings of England are beholding for that footing which they haue in Ireland. Moreouer, he was greatly beloued of Henrie the ſecond King of England, and was afterward Secretarie to King Iohn his ſonne; whoſe name alſo is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and oft mentioned in the Popes Decretals: For being but biſhop of S. Dauids in Wales, he did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding contend with the Archbiſhop of Canturburie about the prerogatiue &amp; primacy: This man, I ſay, in that his booke which he intituled <hi>Itinerarium Balwini Archiepiſcopi Cantuarienſis, crucem in infideles per Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briam praedicantis,</hi> The Iournall or trauels of Baldwin Archbiſhop of Canturbury, when as he preached the Goſpell and croſſe of Chriſt againſt the Infidels thorowout all Wales (whoſe company he neuer forſooke in all that peregrination) writeth thus of the ile MONA. On the morrow we paſſed by the caſtle of Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aruon, and from thence thorow the valleys and ſteepe hilles and mountaines we came vnto Bangor, where we were moſt kindly enterteined of the biſhop (whoſe name was Gwian, who was almoſt conſtrained to take vp the croſſe of Chriſt) with a great lamentation and ſhout of all ſorts of people both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. From thence, croſsing a vety narrow arme of the ſea, we paſſed ouer to MONA, an iland lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two miles off from the maine land. Here Rothericke the yonger ſonne of Owen came very deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all the people of that ile and of the countreys round about him, to meet vs. There they making as it were a theater of the craggie rocks, by the preaching of the Archbiſhop, and of Alexander the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of that place, many were wonne vnto the croſſe and to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, but certeine yong men, luſtie-bloods, of the ſeruants and followers of Rothericke, which ſate oueragainſt vs, would by no meanes be drawen to beare the croſſe. Of theſe ſome, within a little while after, following certeine theeues or free-booters, being ſlaine outright, others hurt and dangerouſly wounded, did of their owne heads lay a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſſe one vpon anothers backe. Rothericke was married to Prince Reeſe's daughter, who was allied to him in the third degree: her, by no admonitions, he could be made to put away from him, hoping that by her meanes he ſhould the better be able to defend himſelfe againſt his brothers children, whom he had diſherited and put by their lands and poſſeſsions: notwithſtanding it fell out contrary to his expectation, for within awhile after they recouered all againe out of his hands. This Iland hath three hundred three and fortie villages or farmes, yet it is eſteemed but at three Cantreds. Britaine hath three ilands lying not farre off from it, all almoſt of like quantitie and bigneſſe: <hi>VVight,</hi> vpon the South; <hi>Mon,</hi> vpon the Weſt;
<pb facs="tcp:23194:342"/> and <hi>Man,</hi> vpon the Northweſt. The two former are very neere to the continent, the armes of the ſea by which they are ſeuered from England, being but very narrow and not farre ouer. The third which is called Man, lieth mid way betweene Vlſter, a prouince of Ireland, and Gallawey of Scotland. Mona, or Mon, of the inhabitants, by reaſon of the great plenty of wheat which it yeeldeth ordinarily euery yeere, is called The mother of Wales. And a little beneath, the ſame Authour writeth thus of this iland: Hugh Earle of Shrewsbury and Arundell, with Hugh Earle of Cheſter, entring this iland by force, did ſhut dogs all night in the church of Fefridanke, which the next morning were found all ſtarke madde; and he himſelfe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the inhabitants of the Orkeney iles, comming thither as pirats and ſea-robbers, vnder the leading of Magnus their captaine, being ſhot in the eye (which part of his body only was vnarmed and ſubiect to the enemies weapon) fell ſtone dead from the decke of the ſhippe into the ſea: which Magnus beholding, cried out in the Daniſh language, <hi>Leit loope,</hi> that is as much to ſay in Engliſh, Let him leape. Moreouer, Henry the Second, going into North-Wales with an armie of men, ioyned battell with the aduerſarie at Caleſhull in a narrow ſtraight betweene two woods, and withall ſent a ſaile of ſhips into Mona, which ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the foreſayd Church with other places there: wherfore they were almoſt all ſlaine, taken, dangerouſly wounded, or put to flight by the inhabitants of that ile. There were in this company two noble men, and his vncle which wrote this ſtory, with other mo ſent hither by the King, to wit, Henry the ſonne of Henry the Firſt, and the vncle of Henry the Second, begotten of the honourable lady Neſta, daughter of Reeſe, Theodore's ſonne, borne in the confines of South-Wales, I meane in the skirts of it next vnto Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia or Weſt-Wales, and the brother of Steuen, brother to Henry by the mothers ſide, but not by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a man that firſt in our dayes, breaking the way for others, not long after this, attempted the entrance and conqueſt of Ireland, whoſe worthy commendations the prophicall hiſtory doth at large ſet foorth. Henry being too venturous, and not being ſeconded in time, was killed at the firſt encounter with a pike. But Robert diſtruſting his owne ſtrength and doubting whether he ſhould be aided or not, fled, and being ſore wounded, very hardly recouered the ſhippes. This iland outwardly appeareth as if it were barren, rough, and ouergrowen, like as the countrey of Pebidion neere Menauia doth, although indeed it be very fertile of many things in diuers places. Thus farre Gyraldus. What could euer be ſpoken or written more plainly and euidently of the name, ſituation, fertility and valourous inhabitants of Mona; as alſo of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and name of that other iland? The ſame authour in his deſcription of Wales, thus ſpeaketh of this Iland: In North-Wales betweene Mona and Snowdon hilles is Bangor the biſhops ſea. As of all Wales, the South part about Cardigan ſhire, (<hi>Cereticam regionem,</hi> he calleth it) but eſpecially euery where in Weſt-Wales, <hi>(Demetia)</hi> by reaſon of the champion plaines, and commodiouſneſſe of the marine coaſts, are farre the more pleaſant and better: ſo North-Wales <hi>(Borealis Venedotia)</hi> is knowen to haue many countries and places farre more ſtrong and better fortified by nature and ſituation, many more goodly braue men, euerie where to haue much better and more fertile ground: For like as Snowdon hilles are thought to be able to finde paſture for all the cattell in Wales if they were all driuen thither, ſo it is reported that the ile Mona <hi>(Angliſea)</hi> may for a time finde all Wales bread-corne; ſuch is the woonderfull ſtore of wheat that it doth yeerely yeeld. What man is he that is ſo blockiſh and void of vnderſtanding, that ſhall read and conſider theſe arguments and allegations, that will make any doubt whether Polydore's Angliſea be the true Mona, that ancient ſeat of the Druides, ſo renowmed by the Romane warres, and oft mentioned in their hiſtories? Moreouer, who can doubt, whether that other Iland, which the Welſhmen call <hi>Manaw,</hi> and the Engliſh <hi>Man,</hi> which he and ſome other learned men (chuſing rather to drinke puddle water from a neere channell, than to ſeeke farther for a cleere ſtreame or pure fountaine) haue falſly named <hi>Mona,</hi> or whether we ought not rather with Ptolemey to call it <hi>Monaria,</hi> or <hi>Monaida; Eubonia,</hi> with Gildas; <hi>Menauia,</hi> with Beda and Henrie Huntington; or <hi>Mania,</hi> with Gyraldus?</p>
            <p>Many more arguments and teſtimonies of learned men I could in this place haue alleaged: but leſt I ſhould be too tedious and troubleſome to the Reader, I will at this time with theſe content my ſelfe: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting but theſe, to any learned man, or any one well acquainted with the Welſh hiſtories, ſhalbe thought ſufficient to ſtop the mouth of the ſcandalous aduerſary, and to anſwer all the cauils of the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enuiours of the Britons glory. Therefore I muſt entreat thee, moſt learned Ortell, for that thy kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and humanity which thou art wont to ſhew to others, to take this in good part, and in that thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Theater, to ſet out this our Mona, in the ancient colours, to the publicke view of the world: And I hope before it be long to ſend you a more abſolute deſcription, not only of this our Mona, but alſo of all Wales, illuſtrated both with the ancient names vſed by the Romans and Britons, and alſo with the moderne Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, whereby they are knowen at this day of that nation. Moreouer, I haue a Geographicall Chart or Map of England, deſcribed according to the moderne ſituation and view, with the ancient names of riuers, townes, people and places, mentioned by Ptolemey, Pliny, Antonine and others, that thoſe groſſe and ſhameleſſe lies of Hector Boothe may by that means the eaſilier be deſcried: againſt which Hector Boothe our Leland, that famous and learned Antiquary wrote this moſt worthy Epigramme: <hi>Hectoris hiſtorici tot, quot mendacia ſcripſit, Si vis vt numerem, Lector amice, tibi; Me iubeas etiam fluctus numerare marinos, Et liquidi ſtellas connumerare poli. Would'st haue me, gentle Reader, tell I he lies that Hector Boothe did write? I may aſwell count ſand of ſea, Or ſtarres of heauen in cleereſt night.</hi> I haue alſo a very exact deſcription of the marine tract or ſea coaſt of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
<pb facs="tcp:23194:342"/> all which when I ſhall come vp to London (which God willing ſhall be before the end of April next) I will ſend vnto you: Whereby the manifeſt and palpable errours of certeine learned men ſhall be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: who in their Geographicall Chart, truſting too confidently to certeine vnlearned mens relations and writings haue moſt falſly and erroneouſly ſet downe the names of diuers places, cities and riuers, to the great preiudice and danger of ſuch as ſhall giue heed vnto them. In the meane time I bid you heartily farewell, beſeeching you, of all loues, if there be any thing wherein I may pleaſure you, not to entreat it, but to command it, by the law of friendſhip and league of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſcholars. Richard Clough, a verie honeſt man, and one that was the cauſe and procurer of this our loue and acquaintance, aſwell your friend as mine, ſhall both bring your letters from you to me, and mine to you, that intereſt I know we both haue in him. Againe farewell, moſt kinde ORTELL: from <hi>Denbigh</hi> in <hi>Guynedh</hi> or North-Wales this fifth of April, in the yeere of our Lord God M.D.LXVIII.</p>
